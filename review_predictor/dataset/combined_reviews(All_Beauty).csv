"I'm absolutely delighted with these!Each and every product in the box is packaged with care, ensuring an easy application.",0
"I purchased this cover January 17, 2011 when I started massage therapy school. I will also mention that when I made my purchase, it was sold as one cover for $8.50. It is a very long lasting cover! Not only did it survive 7 months of use in school, it has been part of my cover collection used for almost 2 years in my practice. It has been laundered and has held up beautifully - no rips, tears, fading or loss of softness. I am considering purchasing more now as my clientele has grown. With the current offer of $32 for a pack of 6, that makes each cover only a little over $5 each. With the track record the one I already have has, I am more than confident in purchasing more!",1
"Love this stuff, works well, nice light scent. Decent size bottle, good price.",1
"Yes, it does smell good...",1
So comfy,1
The product is a fine addition to one's collection and offers a luxurious feel.,0
"These headbands are made of PU leather with what appears to be a cloth covered plastic base. The headbands look good on and are best on those with a full head of hair since they are so large. The glue of the leather to the material was coming apart on one of mine, so the quality is so, so.<br /><br />However, it also came with two polyester-type cloth headbands, a bow hair tie, and a strip of cloth with avocados on them. None of the cloth bands fit me as they are kid-sized. Also, the material feels scratchy and horrible. The avocado tie is okay and so is the hair tie bow.<br /><br />The curent price of $12.99 ($18.99 minus $6) is too much for this ensemble.",1
I am quite pleased with the dnd product I purchased.,0
Works very well,1
"The product's sturdiness and quality is quite impressive, and it delivers great value for its price.",0
"Worked out fine.  Just a bit tight, but o.k.",1
This headband is a great addition to one's home office collection.,0
I'll admit it. I cheaped out on my spray bottle. I'm glad I upgraded. This is so easy to use. It makes wash day and styling so much easier. I only wish it came in a larger size. I highly recommend this.,1
"This flat iron comes with two strange looking hair clips and a carry pouch. However, gloves were not included in the package as I had expected. It is for this reason I lowered my rating. It is deceiving to the customer to purchase an item thinking it comes with gloves when it does not.<br /><br />The controls are in the center of the iron, so I had to be careful not to burn my fingers. To turn the unit on or off, I just held down the power button for three seconds. To go to the next temperature, I just pressed the on/off button quickly. This flat iron heats rapidly. The temperature selections available go from 300 to 450. I used it at 350 degrees to straighten my hair and I was able to do this relatively quickly as I have short curly hair. Also, there was no frizz after I was done. <br /><br />The clips provided are strange looking as can be seen from the photo. They work good enough to hold some of my hair but I particularly do not care for the design.<br /><br />The soft sided cinch pouch is nice and holds both the iron and the clips.<br /><br />In summary, this is a gorgeous iron. I love how the ""blades"" come together and there is no space in-between like some other irons I tried. Also, the current price of $25.91 ($32.39 minus 20%) is very reasonable for this. The Amazon site says ""DUAL VOLTAGE AND COMPLETE ACCESSORIES ..... Equipped with 1x storage bag, 2x hair clips, and 1x Gloves."" Well it was missing the last item. Had it come with the gloves, I would have rated this 4 stars.",1
"I am highly impressed with this set, particularly the keychain carriers. The carriers are larger than I expected and the tie-dye colors are vibrant and attractive. The pocket in the carrier stretches to accept either the spray bottle or flip top ones.<br /><br />There are six keychains with carabiners and what feels like neoprene carriers. Also included are six flip-top bottles and two pump spray bottles. The pump spray bottles dispense a fine mist depending on what I put into them (perfume, hand sanitizer, etc.). The flip-top bottles can dispense hand sanitizer, hand cream, etc. However, since they are hard, I have to hit the bottle against my hand to dispense any cream as it is not conducive to squeezing.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I can put my own travel bottle (if similarly sized) into these keychain carriers. In addition, I can put in a chapstick, nail clipper, etc.<br /><br />The current price of $9.99 is very reasonable for this set.",1
This product review has been written in a slightly generic yet positive style.,0
"I LOVE Hask hair products. I'm a huge fan and have been for some time. So, I was super excited test Hask's body wash.  But I had a problem right from the start. I had to decide between 4 fantastic choices!  Coconut, Lavender + Vanilla, Cucumber + Aloe and Shea + Cocoa Butter. Since it was very warm outside the day I ordered and with summer rapidly approaching, I chose Cucumber + Aloe.<br /><br />Perfect choice!<br /><br />This is a 2 pack of 24.5oz Hask Cucumber + Aloe Body wash. The scent is delicious- light , crisp and not at all overwhelming. The bottle's pump dispenses easily as well as a  good amount of body wash. It lathers quickly and does a great job of cleansing skin.  I also use it while shaving my legs and it works well.  When I step out of the bathtub my skin feels wonderful and I feel nice and relaxed.  The aloe helps hydrate and moisturize my dry, sensitive skin.<br /><br />The 2 bottles are big in size and will last for quite some time in our home.  That, along with the great results make the price reasonable. Recommended!",1
eco friendly and very soft,1
Great amount of products for the price.  A lot of sample sizes but the value on some of the products is insane.  Loved trying so many things that I wouldn't consider normally.,1
"This deodorant has a fairly strong scent that lasts a long time. I haven't notice any staining on any of my tshirts and have been using it consistently for about 5 weeks. If I had anything critical to say about this product, it might be a little too strongly scented, but it works and I've been happy with it.",1
Happy I can still find these for my mom good quality,1
Our product offers a natural look with optimal weight and quality.,0
"This lip butter is pretty much a lip gloss. I haven't noticed any lip plumping action, but it is hydrating. It smells wonderful! There's a slight pinkish tinge to it, but it's sheer and not very prominent. It doesn't last very long and does transfer.",1
This product is a fantastic addition to any skincare routine.,0
"I ordered LA LA Leaf Guayaquil hemp lotion for my husband . While it is indeed a hands and body lotion, it targets especially dry skin areas-elbows, feet and heels. He has unbelievably dry , rough elbows and does so year round. He's always rubbing creams and lotions into his elbows with very little positive results. Until now. LA LA Leaf is softening his terribly dry, cracked elbows and doing so each time  he applies it. He has pretty much stopped complaining about his dry elbows, instead expressing  (nearly EVERY. SINGLE. DAY!) his excitement now that he has finally found a remedy.  lol.  While I ordered LA LA Leaf for him, I've now started to use it on my hands as well. Its lightweight, absorbs quickly and doesn't cause my skin to look or feel oily or greasy. Let me tell you, the hemp oil, rose flower water white bark extract , aloe (a fave of mine) ingredients do a heck of a job softening and smoothing my hands after I apply LA LA Leaf. I'm already planning on using extra LA LA Leaf in the winter when my hands get the dreaded deep, extremely painful cracks due to cold weather. I noticed in the info provided above, this lotion can be used after spending time in the sun. Because my skin is so terribly sensitive and dry, I do believe I will use LA LA Leaf after spending time outside in the sun when the weather gets warmer. Regardless of where you use LA LA Leaf on your body, its going to leave you with soft, smooth skin and will do so quickly.  I do believe LA LA Leaf is worth the cost. It doesn't take much lotion to cover the skin (in the areas we are using it on) so this tube is going to last us a decent amount of time. I have every intention of continuing to use/buy LA LA Leaf. It's wonderful",1
This face serum's skin-nurturing ingredients are expertly formulated to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles while providing a flawless finish.,0

This product review is a comprehensive and detailed account of a user's experience with a particular set of nine soft makeup brushes.,0
"The product offers a pleasing appearance and delightful, long-lasting moisturizing experience.",0
"This is a good way to use a face oil. Normally I skip facial oils because I don't like the way they feel on my face. This one is mixed with a cream, so it doesn't leave your face feeling greasy or oily after applying it. It has a pleasant scent. It isn't sticky though it does leave behind a little tackiness, but that disappears quickly. I'm not really sure what it's supposed to do. I like it. It's definitely hydrating. I do think the descriptions are pretty vague. It doesn't bother my sensitive skin, which is always a plus.",1
"Last summer I decided to grow out my bangs after having them for all of my adult life. I hadn't used much hairspray since the eighties and into the nineties, but I found that I needed to spray my former bangs in order to help train them to their new position. This is a huge bottle of hair spray. It has a standard hair spray smell. It gives a nice mist. It doesn't leave my hair crunchy. It's a flexible hold so my hair moves and looks natural. So far I am pleased with it.",1
Doesn't burn the eyes,1
"One of the reasons skin starts to wrinkle as we age is that we make less and less of the natural oil that keeps skin looking youthful. It's one of the reasons why people with oily skin seem to be ageless for so long. This serum is a good way to supplement what your skin lacks. The oils in this blend are all high quality. Some are slightly unexpected in a skincare product. The texture is lightweight and easily absorbed. It doesn't just sit on top of the skin. Your skin will feel softer immediately and you'll see more improvements over time. Dr. Denese is a trusted brand when it comes to care for aging skin. Whether you're trying to slow the clock or reverse it a little, this serum should be part of your daily skincare routine. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1

This water flosser is an effective way to remove debris between teeth.,0
"This is a nice set of combs--one wide-tooth and one sort of fine-tooth with two regularly-spaced ones. I know others mentioned that they found the combs to be sharp on the edges when combing. The one wide-tooth comb has blunted tines but the other three have pointed tines. However, those pointed tine ones were not sharp on my scalp. I have short to medium fine curly hair and these passed through my hair easily (wet or dry) and I did not feel scratched. I actually like the points massaging my scalp because on the combs I received, they were not super sharp.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I cannot tell if this set is wooden as it claims. It is possible they are wooden but because they are highly polished, they feel and look like plastic. I attend craft shows and it is possible to get a plastic feel and look to wood, so unless I broke one of the combs in half (which I am unwilling to do), I cannot tell. I still think the current price of $9.99 is reasonable even they are plastic.",1
"These shower caps are really attractive in the style I ordered them in. The only issue I have is that I would have preferred them to be a bit snugger. I have a small head and short to medium-length hair, so I need a smaller cap. I am still able to use this in the shower but I have to be careful it does not move around too much.<br /><br />If the elastics were snugger, I would have rated this set of three caps 5 stars.  The current price of $10.99 comes to a reasonable $3.66 each.",1
"We can attest to the exceptional quality and softness of this product, as well as its unique, eye-catching designs.",0
This product is excellent for setting and enhancing the hairstyle of both young and old users.,0
"This is an exceptionally well-made and beautiful brush in a travel size. The brush and handle are small, so this brush is not as easy to grasp as one that is full sized. However, It detangles and brushes through my curls with ease. I also did not experience the typical loss of bristles I usually do with a boar bristle brush. Most animal hair brushes seem to shed for a while and then stop shedding. So far I have not had that problem.<br /><br />I actually cannot believe this is priced at $7.29 because most boar bristles brushes of this size are in the $28 to $30 range. The price, coupled with the style, finish, and functionality of this hairbrush is outstanding in my opinion.",1
"This luxurious, natural hand soap delivers an all-natural clean with a refreshing scent of tea tree.",0
These are nice and fit well and the masks loop in the right place to stay on your face,1
I highly recommend this product.,0
I like to keep extra spray bottles on hand. They're useful for so many purposes. I like to put all of my liquid hair products in them because it's much easier to use a trigger sprayer than a pump when your hands are wet. You can also use them for cleaning products or fabric sprays. This set is a good buy.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,1

Great for your pores and acne. My husband's back started breaking out and after using this for a few days it's clearing up and looks less irritated. Plus it came with a bag which I didn't know what for until I read the instructions and it is a foaming bag and it really makes the soap foam!,1

Great quality soap! So many good ingredients that are good for skin and hydrating not drying. Smells great and skin feels clean and soft after. Highly recommend.,1
I'm so glad I got this product.,0
"I usually use the orange Real Techniques makeup sponge. The diamond sponge is pretty much the same, just a different color and shape. The diamond is much cuter. However, the orange sponge is an overall better shape. I mean, this one will do, but the hard cut edges vs. soft curves make it a little less of an ideal shape for use. But it makes up for that in being really cute.",1
"You know the saying 'kill two birds with one stone'? That is precisely what I had in mind when I ordered Follain Mattifying Moisturizer.  I have dry, sensitive skin but its not oily. My husband has oily skin. I have fine lines and wrinkles on my face. My husband does not.  Because Follain moisturizer promises to combat oily skin, as well as fine lines and wrinkles and is a clean, vegan product, I ordered it to find out if it could help the both of us with our skin issues.  I'm happy to tell you that it has helped the both of us.  The moisturizer is a bit thinner than I'm used to. I don't say that in a bad way because its not at all bad.  One pump of the canister delivers enough moisturizer to cover my facial skin. Its very lightweight and absorbs quickly without leaving a look or feel of oily/greasy skin. It provides immediate hydration and does a nice job of softening my skin. I am VERY happy to say I absolutely have a noticeable reduction in the fine lines and wrinkles on my face. They don't go away entirely, but there is a definite reduction in size and appearance. ( I can't tell you how much I needed to experience this right now as my 49th bday is this week...that means 5-0 isn't far behind and I'm kind of starting to freak about it! )  My husband also tried this for his oily skin with impressive results.  Follain controls his oily skin and prevents the shiny, damp look that comes with oily skin thanks to the mattifying benefit of this moisturizer.  We both use it as needed and not even on a daily basis.  Follain works and it works well. We're both very pleased and grateful for the results!",1
"[[VIDEOID:f77804a8088c40dfbef6fdcfacf8b15a]] There are three individually wrapped bath bombs in this set along with one bar of hand soap and a package of dried rose petals. In total there are five items. The bath bombs spell MOM with the heart substituting for the letter O.<br /><br />The outside packaging looks giftable but the inside is just an ordinary uninspiring throw-away box. The fragrance of the bombs and soap is hardly noticeable. It has a whisper of rose aroma and I detect no lavender at all. I did try the letter M bomb in a hand bath and it dissolved in 5 minutes in lukewarm water and a nice foam of suds lasted about 10 minutes. The results initially felt moisturizing because my hands felt a little oily after the hand bath; however, eventually I needed to moisturize my hands with lotion.<br /><br />With regard to the dried petals, one has to like something like that in their bath because it requires straining the water so that they don't go down the drain. For me, I would never use petals in a bath, so keep the recipient in mind when ordering this.<br /><br />The bar of soap is the only item that would be used by most people.<br /><br />One thing I love is that the color of the dissolved bomb did not adhere to my skin, my hand bath, or my towel. That is not always the case with bath bombs today.<br /><br />The current price of $9.74 ($12.99 minus 25%) comes to $1.95 per item which is reasonable.",1
The Makeup Eraser Cloth is an excellent product that effectively removes makeup without causing any damage to the skin.,0
These are not what I was expecting. They are super nice quality and can almost be used as ear warmers. Vey thick and plush.  I ordered 3. One for my grand daughter and on for each of my nieces. They love them.,1
"This is a very nice set of 6 clips, 10 hair ties, and a case. I particularly love the blue clips. Unfortunately, the first blue one I tried broke immediately as can be seen in the photo. At least I have one blue left. The clips are strong and do  hold a generous amount of hair. I like the non-slippery feeling of the clip itself. The ties are ordinary but still functional.<br /><br />The current price of $7.99 is reasonable for this set but just be aware that the clips will break easily because the plastic is not that strong. I'm definitely annoyed about the one clip that broke.",1
This delightful set of 12 pastel-hued headbands is perfect for young girls or ballerinas alike.,0
I purchased the tool for my 80 year old mom because she like to file her own toes and fingers.  This tool makes it so she can.  The thing I don't like?  That you have to purchase ALL four files - the buffing files (2 of the 4) are useless.  So - it would be nice to be able just to purchase the green and blue ones.  The buffing files just go into the trash.,1
We've been using their products for over 5 years now and it truly is an exceptional choice.,0
Wonderful product that offers great comfort and excellent fit.,0
This goat milk cleanser is an excellent choice for those with sensitive skin.,0
Honest and True: My husband enjoys keeping is travel items organized and it's helps me to keep him properly packed. Great travel bag.,1
I love holographic nail polish does it work definitely the only issues I really have with it the price and the size of the bottle there really is no reason for it to be in such a small bottle,1
"First of all, this is a generous amount of rosehip oil! I've been using it daily for about 2 weeks and I've barely put a dent in it. I've been using it on a burn scar that I have on my arm. The pump lid is easy to use & dispenses a nice amount of oil. One pump is enough for my scar. When I first used it, I was a little concerned, because it comes out a golden color, but when you rub it in, the color completely disappears. It does not leave my hands feeling greasy, which is very important to me. I've been keeping it on my nightstand and applying it at bedtime. If it left my hands feeling sticky or greasy, I would have to get up & wash them. There is a very light, natural scent - it kind of reminds me of a mild olive oil. It's only noticeable when I hold my arm right under my nose. My scar is beginning to diminish. It's still there, but it has faded a little bit. I'm excited to see what happens after more use! The skin around my scar is super soft.  I may start using this to moisturize this winter.",1
Use it for my everyday cologne,1

"I'm so amazed by boar bristle hairbrushes and how incredible they make hair look and feel.  This GAINWELL boar bristle brush is a wonderful, compact brush. It may be small but it works wonders on our family's hair.  It works through tangles without pulling or causing pain while leaving hair soft, shiny and manageable.  The compact size makes it perfect for travel, to keep in a purse, a school/gym locker, briefcase or even a pocket.  If you've never experienced a boar bristle brush, I HIGHLY recommend giving it a try. You can't be the price and the results will be worth it!  If, for some reason you're not satisfied, GAINWELL asks you to contact them for assistance. I can't imagine they receive a ton of calls with issues but its great to know customer service is a  priority!",1
"I burned my back of my hand in a couple of spots this past fall and have been using FLAWless for a short period of time to see if it helps lesson the appearance of those burns. First of all, I would say it's more of a gel than a cream. It's a tan color and is easy to rub into the skin. It doesn't leave behind any stickiness or residue. It also doesn't have much of a scent either. So far I *think* I might be seeing a little fading of my burn scars, but it's not very obvious. However, I am noticing that my freckles and age spots on the back of my hand are looking less noticeable and that's a welcome result. I am anxious to see what happens after continued use.<br /><br />*I  purchased this at a reduced price for the purpose of trying it out &amp; reviewing. My thoughts &amp; opinions are my own.",1
This product is a pleasantly unexpected addition to my collection.,0
"Like other nail polish removers, this MOUNTAIN FALLS REGULAR NAIL POLISH REMOVER (for Natural Nails with Vitamin E and Panthenol, 16 Fluid Ounce) is mostly acetone.  It smells like all the other nail polish removers that I've tried, and works like them, too.<br /><br />I use nail polish remover to take gummy stuff off my hands and other things.  If you use it this way, it's important to remember that it can damage synthetic fabrics, wood finishes, and plastic.  Also, when using or storing it, remember that it's highly flammable, and should NOT be used or stored near fire, flames, or heat.  (See my photo of the bottle label, with all the warnings.)<br /><br />The big 16-oz. bottle is equivalent to two of the regular-size bottles (e.g., [[ASIN:B004X8IFEI Sally Hansen Nail Polish Remover]]) that you find at local grocery and drug stores.",1

"My hairdresser recommended my husband get and use one of these for his thinning hair to use to stimulate the scalp when washing his hair. He also uses it with a rose water spray daily and within six months we have noticed a huge change in the thickness of his hair. I use mine too when I shampoo although I already have incredibly thick hair, and I too have noticed a difference. It also gives a nice lift at the roots too for any ladies with flat hair ( that is why my hairdresser uses them on herself).<br /><br />Great little pack of two. Almost like a his n' hers. Easy to use due to the grip and easy to pull apart and clean. Had ours a while now and still like new. Really great product and super price considering other places on the internet are selling these exact ones at $40 a piece! Pick up a bargain from Amazon.",1

"Thanks to dry, sensitive skin, I'm always a bit concerned when trying new skin care products. With regards to masks, I've tried some that have worked well, some that caused my skin to burn and some that caused my already dry skin to become even drier.  It makes me SO happy to report that I do not experience any negative issues with HUXLEY Secret of the Sahara Clay mask.  I would have been crushed if I had experienced a negative reaction because this really is one heck of a clay mask!<br /><br />Huxley is a nice, gentle mask. But don't let that fool you, it may be gentle but it does a heck of an exceptional job!  It applies nice and easy.  I let it sit on my skin for 10 minutes before rinsing with lukewarm water, right before its nearly dry.  It exfoliates well leaving my skin soft, smooth , a bit brighter and healthy. Dead skin cells are washed away.  My skin literally feels GOOD after using Huxley.  This mask does have a light scent but it doesn't last long. It is recommended Huxley be used 1-3 times a week. I use it twice a week though I could probably get away with using it only a week because the results Huxley delivers are long lasting.<br /><br />I'm so relieved I will be able to continue to use this mask on my skin. Silly as it may sound  I kind of feel like I'm pampering myself when I use it-it makes my skin feel that GOOD!  I will continue to use/purchase Huxley, I'm that satisfied/impressed with what it does for my skin.  I absolutely recommend Huxley.",1
"I guess I'm not the right target audience for this Vitamin C/Retinol Moisturizer. I'm in my early fifties. Both of those ingredients are part of my daily skincare routine, so I thought it would be perfect for me. I did not see the recommended for ages 20-30s before ordering. It has a light, barely noticeable citrus smell to it. It absorbs really quickly but in doing so, I found it to be over drying on my mature skin. Other than that issue, I didn't have any other problems with my sensitive skin. Luckily, I have an eighteen year old daughter so I will pass it along to her to use.",1
"While XXI Bio-Pure facial moisturizer is packed with great skin care ingredients such as jojoba, shea butter, aloe vera, sunflower seed oil and glycerin, I think its the Vitamin C that really makes this an exceptional product.  At least for my skin it's exceptional.<br /><br />This is a nice, lightweight moisturizer that absorbs quickly and doesn't cause skin to look/feel oily or greasy.  It softens and smooths skin. Fine lines are thinned. My dry, sensitive skin looks and feels refreshed.  And thanks to Vitamin C, my normally dull skin has a dewy glow.  I've not found many products that are able to do this to my skin but XXI does!<br /><br />I have dry , sensitive skin and have no issues with this cream<br /><br />XXI works. It works VERY well and some results like soft, smooth skin occur immediately after use.  Results are long lasting.  XXI recommends using this in the morning and at night. I use it once a day in the morning.  A very small amount is sufficient to cover my face.  Because it works so well and delivers great results and only a small amount is needed per use, I do believe the price is reasonable. However, if you find this isn't right for you, XXI offers a 30 day satisfaction guarantee. I absolutely recommend XXI Bio-Pure lotion.",1

"Sheet masks are my favorite part of my skincare routine. They give you time to indulge in ""me time"". These masks work to both hydrate and treat skin. The material adheres to skin well and stretches if you need a little extra coverage. The serum brightens skin and gets rid of dullness. Your skin will look plump and radiant after the first use. I suggest keeping the masks in the refrigerator prior to use. I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

"These brushes are actually like eight combs strung together. I had to set the extra piece that comes with each brush to separate the tines. It was not easy to get the bar across the ""combs"" but eventually I managed. There are only two places the bar should be put and that is where the holes are on the back of the ""brush."" I assembled these brushes on the lower holes. My biggest issue with these brushes is that there are only two holes to lock the bar in place when I prefer four holes like my Heeta detangling brush (product number B0836XT7J8 since the Amazon embedded links are not working).<br /><br />Once this is assembled, it glides through the hair and detangles. It works well on dry hair but even better on wet hair. I love the hard tines as it is like getting a massage on the scalp. The handle provides an okay grip but I would have preferred a silicone grip. Since the combs are separated, this brush can act as a vent brush for blow drying even though it is not of circular design. Hair can be removed easily since the tines are flat with no ""ball"" tip.<br /><br />The only reason I rated this three stars is because of the hard time I had assembling the rod in place on each one, the lack of four holes for a secure fit, and the lack of silicone grip on the handle. Otherwise they work well. The current price of $8.99 is reasonable for two detanglers.",1
This product is an excellent addition to any skincare regimen.,0
"I'm a curly girl. One of the constant struggles with my type of hair is that it may look dull sometimes since it's so dark. This shine spray is like a makeover in a bottle. It adds instant shine and makes it look like you had a color touch-up. The formula is lightweight and non-greasy. It has a light, somewhat floral scent. I would definitely spend my own money to purchase this product. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1
"Our face cream is truly luxurious, with a rich and creamy texture that feels wonderful on the skin.",0
This particular lip balm offers a delightful experience with its soft and soothing texture that is perfect for everyday wear.,0
"This moisturizer is ideal for most skin types. It is fairly lightweight and provides deep hydration. It's especially good for sensitive or reactive skin. It's a good choice for those with rosacea, eczema or acne. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1
"Wonderful for skin and hair, really works!!!",1
I was delighted to receive my new eyebrows in the mail.,0
"This flat iron works well to straighten hair, but I couldn't get it to curl very well like other straighteners I have. It is easy to use and the red light on the dial turns green when it is ready which is nice.",1
Excellent performance and top-notch quality make this product a surefire winner.,0
This headband offers a practical and stylish solution for those who need to wear a face mask frequently.,0
It is with great pleasure that I have been able to try this remarkable mascara for a period of two months.,0
love this product good price,1
"Purchased these 15 months ago and all are still completely functional. Strong Zippers, wide opening and easy to clean. Use for storage around the house every day. We Highly recommend this brand InnoGear and this product. Sturdy construction!",1
"Never tried poly gel before, definitely not easy but worth it! Check out my nails in the photo, came out beautifully and they are very strong!",1
"When I saw this, I was thrilled to be able to try it. I have suffered from bags and dark circles under my eyes for years now. I have been 'using' this for almost three weeks and I am not happy with it. First, it's almost impossible for me to keep it in place under my eyes. They come wet out of the packet and I was unsure what side was supposed to be placed on my skin. They do not stay in place and I found them falling off easily. Of course, maybe it was me or my skin, so please don't just rely on my review (read others). I will not be reordering.",1
Adorable and hold up just fine,1
"This mask support works great.  It does what it's supposed to do. It keeps your mask off of your mouth and nose, allowing more airflow.  You mouth and nose are still covered, but the fabric isn't right up against your face.",1
"Offering a colorful collection of headbands at an incredibly reasonable price, this product is definitely a must-have!Designed with both style and comfort in mind, each headband boasts elastic stretches to keep hair in place.",0
"Rrain hats are really handy when<br />one doesn't have an umbrella, and<br />easy to carry in a purse or pocket.",1
"I found these masks to be comfortable and well-fitted, with loops that ensured they stayed in place.",0

The fragrance of Shakira's perfume is a delightful blend of sweet and spicy aromas.,0
I promised to retract the negative review once I received the product.  Thank you,1
I have been wanting to try these food peels. I was nervous to try but after reading some of the other reviews I finally did and am glad I did. Followed directions and my feet started to peel the next day. No bad reactions or problems. I didn't use the included tool. Soaking your feet each day helps with the peeling process.,1
This skincare set is a delightful and luxurious addition to anyone's collection.,0
My granddaughter wanted this and I was skeptical. But being grandma I ordered it! She loves it. Super easy to use and looks great on. The polish lasts well. Great value for the price.,1
"These stylish headbands evoke a timeless, classic aesthetic with their muted colors and simple design.",0
"There are 14 brushes in this set. There are brushes for foundation, blush, eyeshadow, eye blending (fan brush), etc. In fact, there are more brushes than I needed. <br /><br />The one unique brush in this set (see photo) is the one that looks like a paint brush. This is perfect for cheek highlighting.<br /><br />The bristles are relatively soft but not as soft as I expected. They feel pretty good against my skin but not great. Also, the heads have a slight odor. The PU brush case has a tremendous chemical odor and needs to be aired out a while.<br /><br />This is a bargain basement travel set for someone who is starting their make-up journey. The current price of $11.19 comes to $.80 cents per brush. In this case one gets what they pay for; it's a marginal price for a marginal quality set that is functional. ",1
This product offers a delightful aroma and rich lather that will leave your skin feeling refreshed and clean.,0
There are two quality headbands in this set. The headbands are SUPER SOFT that I just want to feel them all day. They look great on and I love the design.<br /><br />I have short to medium-length fine curly hair and these work for me and are even better for someone with long hair. I actually put them over my ears so that they stay put. I have to do that with every headband I use.<br /><br />The current price of $3.99 is a reasonable $2 per band.,1
"I purchased these items for creating essential oils products for cleaning, health, and first aid.  These bottles are beautiful cobalt blue bottles, and the perfect size to fit into medicine cabinet. I love that they came with labels.",1
"This delightful set of 6 clips, 10 hair ties, and a case is a wonderful addition to any hair styling collection.",0
I would highly recommend this product to anyone in the market for a 5 blade razor.,0
This anti-aging serum comes in a glass bottle with a dropper applicator.,0
"This mascara has been a game-changer for me, enhancing the length and thickness of my lashes without clumping or flaking.",0
"These look like nice tweezers, similar in look to tweezerman tweezers but for some reason they don't grip hairs very well and are very annoying for me. They seem to match up perfectly at the end so not sure why they don't grab well. Will use as backups or keep in purse or car.",1
The product is well-suited for those looking to style their shoulder-length hair.,0
"[[VIDEOID:e487d57bdd82c5405085efb372c8fecd]]<br />This straightener is a nice metallic black and comes with a thin storage sleeve. There is a tiny instruction pamphlet included.<br /><br />The flat iron feels good in my hands. I like that the cord swivels at the base so that it does not tangle.<br /><br />This did an okay job on my hair. I have fine medium length hair and this mostly relaxed my curls so that my hair was more wavy that fully flat. I set the temperature to 300 for fine hair. I also tried 350.<br /><br />There are several things that make this iron just okay for me. First, it is weird to have the temperature controls between the flat iron blades. There is a constant temperature key and also temperature plus and minus keys, in case the constant temperature key is not set.<br /><br />The power button should be pressed to start setting the temperature and then when the LCD stops flashing, it has reached that temperature. Then the power button has to be pressed again so that the light in the middle of the plate lights up.<br /><br />The plates have some space between them and they are offset a bit from each other which is the biggest annoyance to me. I guess this is why it straightened my hair only so much. This is not a bad flat iron but it is not perfect either.",1
"Incredible for effortlessly untangling hair
Conclusion: Highly recommend for anyone needing a hair detangler.",0

"I take Melatonin to help me sleep just about every night.  I had NO CLUE melatonin helps improve skin condition as well!  I have very positive results when I take it to help me sleep. I'm guessing it plays a role in why I experience  great results with MU TENUTO Bereceuse Water Gel cream as well! I love the consistency of this cream. Its a nice, light gel.  It doesn't take much cream at all to cover my face. It applies/spreads so easily on skin.  The first time I used it, I was concerned that it was going to be sticky.  Fortunately, that's not the case.  It absorbs quickly leaving my skin soft and smooth immediately.  I can not only see it but I can feel how it hydrates my skin as well. My skin is normally extremely sensitive and very dry.  The hydration really makes my skin feel great.  I apply the cream at night before bed and enjoy the results in the morning when I awaken.  Lavender is one of my favorite scents.  But I just do not care much for the scent of this cream.  I will not deduct a star from my rating due to the scent...the scent doesn't last long at all.  I don't think its fair to penalize the cream for a scent that doesn't last long.  I have no negative reactions to MU TENUTO. It works and feels great on my sensitive skin.  For those interested in packaging, the jar is glass-nice and heavy with music notes all around it. And here's a neat feature...if you scan the QR code on the package, a snippet of classic music will play on your Smart phone! That's pretty neat.<br /><br />I love what MU  TENUTO does for my skin and works with the very first use!  I find the price reasonable.  This is an excellent cream-it takes wonderful care of my dry, sensitive skin. Definitely recommended!",1
"The product is a large and heavy dryer, designed to meet various drying requirements.",0
This product is a superb choice for those looking to enhance their makeup application.,0
This is an amazing contour pallette,1
"This product is geared towards the youthful demographic, catering to those in their early to mid-thirties.",0
"The lashed are pretty but the band is too wide, it covers too much of the eyelid. Also the way it's packaged makes it difficult to remove from plastic casing and tears the lash strip.",1
I was delighted to experience a variety of skin care benefits when using this product set.,0
"The product's creamy texture and easy application make it a delightful experience, while its pleasant scent lingers on the hair.",0
"These do make affordably unique party favor gifts! The holographic print diamond ring designs are pretty, and I think the featured wording is memorable and cute! I will say that these hair coils are slightly larger than several others I've tried, so they don't seem to be as tight and stretchy as the ones I'm generally used to, but they do make a nice “ring” design for the card, and the iridescent shade of purple is really attractive. Since they all come squashed together in a plastic bag with a slide zipper, they do move around and bend a lot. Because of that, 3 of the 7 decorative backing cards I received had obvious crinkles and bends across one bottom corner. They did flatten back out for the most part, but I still wish I'd received an entire set of pristine cards that were undamaged. They'd make great gifts for bachelorette parties or bridal shower events!",1
"I really like this face oil by Dose of Colors. It is fragrance free, but it has a light, pleasant smell to it. It does feel a bit oily, but that goes away after several minutes. I'm only using this at nighttime, because it's too heavy for daytime use in my opinion. It doesn't annoy my sensitive skin. It leaves my skin feeling super soft!",1
This hairband is a delightful addition to any hairstyle.,0
This product has been a reliable and trustworthy choice for over a decade.,0
"This product truly offers a remarkable experience with its unique fiber shape that instantly enhances the look of your lashes, providing a POP effect.",0
"This hand soap provides an effective and hygienic sense of all-natural clean! While I don't readily detect a heady scent of lavender oil, I will say that an earthy tea tree scent is freshly omnipresent. I love that this is a vegan, cruelty-free product that's been consciously sourced, packaged, and produced, and the included pump dispenser seems to be quite sturdy and reliable. I appreciate that the bottle arrived with a secure safety seal in place, and I definitely didn't have any product leak out during shipment. There's also an expiration date handily provided on the bottle's base.<br /><br />This slippery, soapy gel solution creates a visible sudsing effect, and it feels quite hydrating overall! It rinses away cleanly and leaves my family's hands feeling nice and soft every time. I love using essential oils to help provide a renewed sense of revitalization and freshness around my home, so I'm gladly adding this Canadian hand wash to my daily cleansing arsenal.",1
I am quite pleased to share my experience with these splendid products.,0
"The product is of high quality, well-made, and performs as expected.",0
This headband is aesthetically pleasing and comfortable to wear.,0
"I love the dnd product.  I received 2 top coats and two base coats.  Wanted 4 top coats (as advertised).  They were in different bottles than what I've had before.  The top coat is thicker and yellows on my ""White polish"".  Oh well . . .  I don't use white polish often . . .",1
"These products are quite excellent, and they meet all expectations.",0
i had a small one  that just got destroyed  these wires are much longer and bigger  i expect to live a lot longer than the tiny one i had !,1
"There are six (6) velvet headbands with buttons in this set. Each headband is narrow at only 8-3/4"" wide and certainly not as wide as pictured on the Amazon site. Also, there are buttons on each side of the ear area. When I attach my mask to these buttons, my face mask is no longer tight to my face because the slinky velvet material moves and does not stay in place.<br /><br />Overall, I do not like these at all. They will suffice as headbands only and not for mask attachment. The current price of $11.99 comes to $2 per band but I do not feel they are worth that price at all.",1
"I got this CURECODE serum in hopes of introducing more moisture to my dry face (gotta love winter). The very first thing I noticed was that, while there are directions on the box, there are NO instructions on the bottle itself. I'm not in the habit of keeping the packaging (who does that?!).. they need to add the directions onto the bottle label!<br /><br />The serum itself is pleasing. There was NO scent (THANK YOU!), my sensitive skin had no negative reactions at all and I was pleased with the thickness. It didn't completely absorb into my skin.. I had a few pieces of pillow lint (flannel sheets) stuck to my cheeks the next morning. I can't say how well it works long term yet, but I have high hopes as my skin was more supple the next am. I will update this review if I have any negative reactions.",1
I am quite pleased to hear that your daughter has found a new favorite in the Tressa range from Pantene.,0

The product review provided accurate information regarding the 14 brushes in the set.,0
"I have one of the original Makeup Erasers and to be honest, I can't tell the difference between these cloths or the original one. Well, that's not entirely true, I can tell the difference. These have a hanging loop and the name brand ones don't! Side by side, they are identical. These are just as soft. They do an impressive job of removing makeup, especially mascara. They are gently on my skin. These come in a set of 2, plus the set is half the price of the original. I will be ordering some of these for the girls in my life!",1
This delightful set of six sheet masks offers a variety of benefits to suit every skin type.,0
Tiny waver that works great to make smaller sized waves. Heats quickly and makes waves quickly. Only took a few minutes to do all of my daughters hair.  I only do a top layer of hair and around the face. Find that it looks less poofy this way. Seems well made and good quality.,1
"The dazzling array of colors is a stand-out feature, with multiple hues to choose from.",0
safe step up to whatever you can't reach.  i use it to get into the tub easier.  it is quality built and does the job.,1
Great for acne prone skin,1
This is far too heavy and greasy to be applied on the eyes.  It earned stars because it wasn't a total waste; it will work as a lip balm.,1
"There are four typical no-frills extra large shower caps (red, tan, purple, and black). They fit me but have lots of room to spare. They are waterproof as the water just runs right off the exterior. There is an elasticized strap in the cap that can be adjusted. I adjusted one of them and it looked very lopsided on my head as a result of the adjustment.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these are not my favorite caps. They are too big and the adjustment throws the elastic out of whack. The current price of $11.99 comes to $4 per cap.",1
These products are a must-have for anyone looking to enhance their daily productivity.,0
"This is a nice set of 10 colored blending sponges all with an angled side. I love the sponges as they are dense.<br /><br />The flat / angled side is great for smooth applications. They feel good in my hands, blend well, and feel soft against my skin. Since these are dense, they do not soak up as much foundation as others that are more airy.<br /><br />These blenders make a great gift for the make-up obsessed. These are also perfect as gifts for the Easter Basket or as a stocking stuffer. I love that the sponges do not smell. I tried other colored sponges and they smell like pencil shavings or other chemicals and these do not.<br /><br />At the current price of $8.49 ($9.99 minus 15%) these are a reasonable $.85 per sponge.",1
"At last, gluten-free deli bread! There are a few good gluten-free breads made without wheat, but they just don't have the flavor of this deli-style bread with sour dough in the ingredient list. This is the first on the market that I know of and it is delicious.There are 5 large deli size slices in a package. I find that a half slice for an open-face sandwich is just the right amount for me. For those of us in the gluten-free community, a deli-style bread is the bread most missed. This Schar bread is expensive but worth every penny! P.S. To follow up on this earlier review, Schar has reduced the size of the deli-style slices to about 2/3 of the original size, AND increased the price! I will still buy this bread, but with a heavy heart!",1
Just nail polish despite numerous attempts just will not put the cat by Design on in anything that is almost so faded you cannot forget it cannot be blamed on the magnets because I have probably close to 25 magnets and I have run into the same problem with all of them follow the instructions to a T and it's always very very faded,1
I was pleasantly surprised by the exceptional quality of this scrub.,0
"This single layer thin blue shower disposable shower caps are tiny. They are really for a kids head. I can barely get my hair into this. There are 120 (I did not count them) tiny blue slivers that have to be unraveled. Since they are so small,  these would work best to cover the tops of small serving bowls during a picnic to keep the flies away. These are functional but I am not impressed.",1
"Very well made,good quality and very good color.",1
"I bought one and after trying it, I bought three more so I would always have one handy.",1
This product truly delivers on its promise.,0
"There are three packages of wafer thin sheets of soap in 80 sheets each pack. The wafers are attached in the center but pull apart easily. There is also a sliding top tin supplied that will hole 80 sheets. Be careful not to get them wet as even a drop of water causes them to dissolve. When I washed my hands with one sheet, it created a nice lather and left my hands clean. I do not feel that it was moisturizing as claimed. Also, even though there are three wonderful fragrances (lavender & aloe, bergamot & ylang ylang, and jasmine & patchouli) that smell great as a whole 80 sheets, that fragrance does not come through on the hands because the soap is too thin to leave any fragrance behind.<br /><br />The current price of $13.95 comes to $.06 cents per sheet. I consider these perfect for when using a public restroom that has water but no soap. It is also great for camping or any place where portability is paramount without carrying a full wet bar of soap in a container.",1
"This mask set allows you to choose exactly what your skin needs on any given day. There are five types. There's one for hydration, firming, brightening, healthy aging, and pore detoxing. For best results, leave the masks on for at least 15 minutes. Use the excess serum on your neck. I highly recommend this set.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1
I was impressed by the strength and durability of this product.,0
"My husband started a business recently and was looking at options for his bookkeeping. He knew that he wanted to use QuickBooks from his previous experience. Originally he was going to use the web based version, but since this comes with a year of enhanced payroll, he decided to go with this. He consulted with an accountant in getting it set up for his company's needs. He did have to contact customer support to help him get the enhanced payroll feature working. For some reason, it had the number 1234567 prefilled and he couldn't change it without customer support. So far it has been easy to use and has done everything he's needed it to do.",1
"For a new (or at least new to me) brand of hand sanitizer, I am pleased with it. I like the pump dispenser which is easy to use. The bottles are a good size. While you can detect the smell of the alcohol, it's not too strong or overpowering like some can be.  With so many new brands out there these day, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase again.",1
The product is an excellent choice for those who enjoy a bold fragrance.,0
"The Anti-Aging sheet masks in this pack come individually wrapped, offering a hygienic way to apply them.",0

Tinazana's Pineapple Deep Cleanser is an excellent addition to any skincare routine.,0
These unique party favors are an affordable and memorable addition to any occasion.,0
"After moistening my face and the brush heads with water, I tested the sensitive and normal heads with both soap and [[ASIN:B01648QDS4 L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Cream Cleanser, 5 Fluid Ounce]] and the massaging head with water alone. After a one-minute &#34;application&#34; with any one of the brushes, I love how smooth and clean this makes my face feel.<br /><br />The packages includes:<br /><br />- three brush heads (sensitive, normal, and massage) and their covers which have air vents to hasten drying<br />- one charging base with power cord<br />- one brush wand that operates at 3 speed levels<br />- one white plastic zippered travel case<br />- one instruction pamphlet<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- The wand contains a rechargeable battery that last for 30 uses. The first charge takes up to six hours.  It also has a 30 minute fast-charge feature that will provide 4-5 uses. By the way, I love the charging light on the base; it has a &#34;cool&#34; factor to it.<br /><br />- There's a one minute timer that has what I call a &#34;tripacer&#34; (like Sonicare's quadpacer) timer built in for each of the three zones of the face. These zones are the T zone, left side, and right side. What this means is that the unit pauses ever so slightly ever twenty seconds to let the user know when it's time to move on to the next zone so that the cleaning time can be distributed evenly among zones.<br /><br />- None of the three brushes were rough or extremely abrasive. The rotating and vibrating brush heads were as gentle as could be and I have sensitive skin.<br /><br />- The wand with brush can be used in the shower as long as it's not fully submerged in water.<br /><br />- This can be used to remove cosmetics.<br /><br />- The unit comes with a 2-year limited warranty.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- Although these brushes remove make-up effectively, I personally only like to use this on the days I do not wear makeup. The reason is that the eye area has to be avoided. I use eye makeup so I wind up washing my entire face with my hands instead as it does not make sense to me to use a brush on only part of my face.<br /><br />- There are a lot of don'ts in the manual like don't submerge in water, don't use around the eyes, don't use if you are taking steroid-based medication, don't operate outdoors or where there are aerosol products or oxygen being administered, etc.<br /><br />- If used daily at no more than the maximum two times per day, the brush heads need to be replaced  every three months. The Massaging head (since it doesn't not have bristles) can be replaced every six months. This can get expensive. I contacted the company for the replacement price and they said they would let me know when it's orderable on Amazon. I will update the comments section of this review with that information when I receive it.<br /><br />- The battery on this unit is NOT replaceable as per the email from them which I posted in the comments section of this review.<br /><br />At first I questioned why would I need such a facial cleansing tool. After using this, however, I realized that I love how it makes my face feel so clean and smooth. This is not a tool I would use more than twice per week since I really hate using this to remove makeup, however, it's so gentle on my skin that I look forward to the cleansing action, mildly exfoliating properties, and the light massage it provides me all without the use of a chemical masque.",1
"These diamond are absolutely beautiful and shine so well. Not cheesy like some of the colored diamonds can, does not look like cheap plastic at all.<br />I would definitely buy again.<br />Follow me on Instagram @theenailgame",1
its OK  not as good as the  original Wet Brush  just a knock off,1
"I really like that this mask includes special patches for the eyes and smile lines. If you're over 30, you'll appreciate the extra help. You apply the patches first, the the sheet mask. I keep all of my sheet masks in the refrigerator. You'll appreciate the cooling and anti-inflammatory effect if you do so with this mask. I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1
It is a nice grip for my clippers but the bottom slides around so what's the big idea!,1
"The packaging is adorable, and the texture is luxurious.",0
Excellent product.,0
Great set of oils that are great to use as is or when making other products. I used the coconut oil in a roller ball with some tea tree and clove oil for a rash and it works great. They are both have no scent.,1
This is the best moisturizer I've ever used. It smells like a tropical vacation and leaves my curls plump and shiny. It's like the Holy Grail of natural hair products.,1
"The product offers a unique blend of ingredients including collagen, hyaluronic acid, and aloe vera to address dark circles and puffy eyes.",0
"As I have gotten older (I'm in my early fifties), I've noticed that my eyelashes have become sparser. This eyelash growth serum is easy to use. It doesn't sting or irritate my sensitive eyes either. I haven't seen much change in the length of my lashes yet, but I think I can see some new growth or density. I will continue using this and update my review if necessary.",1
"I wear headbands like this in the evening when washing my face and following my skincare routine. These headbands are very soft. I found these to be a little small, but they do stretch enough to accommodate my large head. I have just had other headbands that were a little larger and didn't require being stretched to the max just to fit. I like the variety of colors and have shared these with my eighteen year old daughter. One thing that I do like is that the bow doesn't get off centered as easily as my old one. My old one has to be adjusted every time I put it on. This one seems to be just fine.",1
Excellent Product. Pleasing Bouquet That Lingers Well. Softens My Skin. Love This Product & Brand.,1
This set of five individually wrapped pink-colored blending sponges boasts a unique angled design that allows for precise and even application.,0
"Very natural, light weight and good quality. I use on brides who are not use to lashes but still want a bit of length and definition.",1
"I am in my early 50's and have been a regular user of anti-aging products for the past several years. This serum comes in a glass bottle and has a dropper applicator. It takes about half of the dropper to cover my face. It has a tacky (but not sticky) feel to it which remains for a while even after it has absorbed into the skin. The microbeads have to be crushed or else you have little white beads on your face. It's not difficult to break the beads. I just press on them and they rub into the skin. After applying the serum, my face was really dry. I have been using this at night. I have a multi-step skin care routine so I followed this with my nighttime moisturizer, then retinol, and some face oil. The serum doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. There is a mild scent, but nothing that I could recognize. Overall, it's okay. I haven't noticed any tightening or improvements in my skin. However, as a regular user of anti-aging products, I wasn't expecting anything new.",1
I am quite pleased with my purchase.,0
Perfect !,1
The product's delightful tea tree fragrance delicately blends with its conditioning properties for a delightful experience.,0
"There are four tiny colorful squeeze bottles in this package that are easy to fill and easy to dispense. I like that they are portable and can hang on a keychain. These can be used for hand lotion, sunscreen, hand sanitizer, etc. However, the caps do open easily so it is possible the contents will be squeezed out inside a purse if there is a lot of movement. Secondly, the current price of $12.99 is way too expensive for what this is. I would not expect this to be priced at more than $6.",1
"I purchased this for my shoulder length hair. It's very difficult to use, would be best used on longer hair. It's a bit hard to wind the hair around this iron when it's my length.",1
"I have been using this mascara for about 2 months now and I am in awe at the difference in my lashes. And I've used it all! I've tried so many types of mascara even went thru falsies, extensions. And I love this product. It lengthens, plumps, and makes my lashes LOOK healthier. I highly recommend!",1
"Terrific list of ingredients, this stuff is the real deal. I could feel immediately on application that this product contained Retinol as advertised and not a watered down 'serum' variation. Remember to moisturize after. This is a terrific product to use as your Retinol go to.<br /><br />I got a lot of info from Marie Claire article by Katie Thomas 'Retinol - the only ingredient that will reduce wrinkles'<br /><br />Your skin's collagen level starts to deplete at age 25.<br />Retinol helps with skin elasticity, wrinkles/laugh lines and pigmentation aka age spots.<br />Retinol is a derivative of vitamin A.<br />Start low ( 0.3%)  increase to 0.5%. 1% is best but only available with a prescription.<br />When you first try your skin may get dry, red & flaky.<br />Only use twice a week, gradually increase to daily as desired.<br />Apply a pea-sized amount at first and increase amount and % as negative side effects decrease.<br />Use anytime day or night, just use sunscreen after if going outdoors.<br />Anywhere you see signs of aging is a good place to apply, face, arms, hands, legs, neck.<br />Avoid the skin around your eyes as it is too delicate.<br /><br />Aqua/Water/Eau,<br />Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (emollient/natural moisturizing factor/replenishment/texture),<br />Glycerin (hydration/natural moisturizing factor/replenishment),<br />Dimethicone (conditioner/silicone),<br />Glyceryl Stearate (emollient/emulsifier),<br />PEG-100 Stearate (emulsifier),<br />Polysorbate 20 (emulsifier),<br />***Retinol (age delay/brightener),<br />Phenoxyethanol (preservative),<br />Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer (hydration/replenishment/restoration),<br />Carbomer (thickener),<br />Cetearyl Alcohol (thickener),<br />Caprylyl Glycol (conditioner/emollient/preservative),<br />Ceteareth-20 (emollient/emulsifier),<br />Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative),<br />BHT (preservative), Allantoin (sooth),<br />Disodium EDTA (pH buffer/preservative),<br />Hexylene Glycol (preservative),<br />Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster),<br />Pentylene Glycol (solvent),<br />BHA (preservative),<br />1,2-Hexanediol (preservative),<br />Beta-Glucan (antioxidant/sooth),<br />Myristoyl Pentapeptide-8 (age delay)",1
"These look and fit BAD.<br />Fake looking.<br />Not dentures fake- Halloween fake.<br />Plus they don't conform in your mouth. They are bulky. They require major adjustments with power tools to fit properly. These are a joke. If your getting them for a prank or to play dress up, I guess they'd do.<br />If you need a decent temporary smile that looks and feels good, go with Imako.",1
"[[VIDEOID:e487d57bdd82c5405085efb372c8fecd]]<br />This metallic black straightener offers versatility and convenience, even for those with fine, wavy hair.",0
"The blend of royal jelly, botanical, and floral extracts gives this Korean beauty essence a nice ingredient profile, and the overall scent is pleasingly fresh and sweet. Each of the pouches has a small twist-off cap and the liquid contents are clear (and seem to have a high water content). The spread solution initially dries a little stickier than I'd prefer it to (stickier than a well-absorbed moisturizing lotion would), but the eventual result feels hydrating overall. Due to the compact size and flattened shape, these pouches would be great for travel. Especially after a day at the beach!",1
"I can get 750 J&J Qtips for a $4.64. So this all comes down to the environment.<br /><br />The J&J swabs come in plastic container and these come in a box which is kinder to the planet.<br /><br />These have a bamboo stem and the J&J are plastic! (I always thought they were paper!). And I am LOVING how sturdy the stems are: they don't bend, not that I use force when using, it just makes for a sure grip.<br /><br />I did a side by side and the tips are the same thickness.",1
"I wish I could wear these colors but most of them are too deeply hued for my fair complexion. I tried several of the colors and many make my eyes look swollen and puffy as if I had an eye infection. If I had olive or brown skin, I think these colors would look awesome. The only colors I was able to wear in this pallet are the pearl, volcano, bronze, sunset, 24k, and ash. I absolutely love the shimmer on many of these. I like that the ""compact pallet holder"" has a magnetic closure. Eye applicators have to be purchased separately.  Despite this, I think $7.88 is a great price for this selection. The colors that I did apply stayed put all day.<br /><br />The 15 colors starting from top row left to right and working down are:<br />- copper<br />- cinnamond<br />- pearl<br />- golden<br />- bronze<br />- volcano<br />- sunset<br />- pumpkin<br />- 24k<br />- moch<br />- fleshy<br />- mermaid<br />- rose<br />- ash<br />- ginger",1
"This goat milk cleanser is very gentle. I have sensitive skin and it doesn't irritate or annoy my skin at all. It has a pump dispenser that works nicely. It's thick, like a lotion consistency. The cleanser doesn't lather or foam. I haven't been able to notice any scent, good or bad. It doesn't dry out my skin. I'm very pleased with it.",1
"Very surprised! I am please with first round on my black, dyed hair. Turned a dark brown! Second round in a couple of days. (Suggest a leave in hair oil from scalp to roots for before and after use) hair is soft after use. Has an odor, but not overwhelming if you cover with disposable hair cap. Easy to use.",1
"When seeking out these products, it's important to be aware of the variety of options available.",0
"This shampoo and conditioner travel-size duo (2 ounces each bottle) has a spicy aroma that is neither pleasant nor offensive but not my favorite smell.  The shampoo produces a medium lather and cleans well. The conditioner is creamy and conditions well. When my hair dried, it had a sheen to it and was well nourished and my curls were enhanced.<br /><br />The current price of $14 for this set is expensive. If this had an intoxicating fragrance I liked and was more reasonably priced, I would have loved it. However, this is not a set I would buy at this price.<br /><br />Note that I get about four uses to this set for my short to medium hair.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/22/20 - This only lasted me three uses. However, I had such trouble getting both the remaining shampoo and conditioner (particularly the conditioner) out of the bottle. They need to change this to a squeeze tube. I actually had to fill the bottle with water several times to dislodge the remaining ingredients. Also, the conditioner makes the floor of the shower or tub very slippery (almost as if I put Pledge on a floor).  Based on this, I lowered my ranking from 4 to 2 stars.",1
"I love this skincare set! The pale pink rose quartz hue is such a pretty shade, and the paired duo arrives safely nestled within a cushioned pillow of foam cutouts. The dual-ended roller exhibits smooth and silent movement, and the gua sha stone is perfectly sized and comfortable to hold! The warm gold metal hardware pieces complement the pink color beautifully, and the overall craftsmanship of this set is impressive. This product would make a chic and affordable gift for yourself or a loved one!",1
"We were delighted to come across such a delightful collection of Korean hair masks from [Brand Name].Each mask is carefully designed to cater to a range of hair types and concerns, such as dandruff, dry scalp, and frizz.",0
"This serum is more the consistency of a lotion than serums that I have used in the past. It has a nice fruity smell. It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. The serum absorbs quickly and isn't tacky or sticky. I am in my early fifties and use an assortment of anti-aging products daily. I haven't seen any new miraculous results with this, but it does moisturize. As a regular user of such products, I really don't think I would see anything new from them, but rather a continuation of what I have already started to achieve.",1
This product offers reliable and efficient performance in eliminating food particles from the toilet.,0
"The lashed are pretty but the band is too wide, it covers too much of the eyelid. Also the way it's packaged makes it difficult to remove from plastic casing and tears the lash strip.",1
"The item is a wonderful gift for children, and it has been thoroughly enjoyed by my family member.",0
"This is an ideal moisturizer for my dry, sensitive, aging skin. It applies easily and absorption is fast. Does a nice job of calming the patches of eczema while moisturizing and firming. I like the ingredients, especially the cactus oil. There is a scent; its a nice scent but it fades quickly. The price is on the high side but worth it.",1
"There are supposed to be six green and one white scrunchies but I received an additional white one to bring my total up to eight scrunchies. However, only seven are supposed to be shipped.<br /><br />These hair ties are dressy and nice. The scrunchie expands to hold a good amount of hair. Of course, when applying one of these, it is important to turn it so the tail goes down. That can sometimes be tricky.<br /><br />The only negative I see is that the seam shows the stitching as can be seen in my photo. They should have covered this with the area that is tied (meaning the area where the tail flows down). This is the only reason I took off one star.<br /><br />The current price of $12.99 comes to $1.86 per scrunchie if one receives seven (and not eight) scrunchies.",1
This set of 10 colored blending sponges is an excellent addition to any make-up artist's collection.,0
"These Pinrose Gilded Fox petals are a fun way to try out a new scent! The box comes with 12 packets. Each packet has a fragrance infused towelette. They aren't too wet, but you are able to rub or wipe them on your pulse points or wherever and transfer the scent to your body. This one has a very interesting smell. At first I didn't detect the chocolate, so it's a bit subtle. The smell is a powdery sweetness with a hint of chocolate. I threw away the wipe in my office trash can and caught pleasant whiffs of it throughout the day. Since the box comes with so many, I plan to put some in my daughter's Christmas stocking so she can try them out. They would also be great for traveling.",1
This product boasts a delightful fragrance and an incredibly smooth texture.,0

"This face wash provides an invigorating sense of clean with a burst of fresh citrus zing! I love that it contains aloe vera, vitamin C, rose hip oil, and lemon and orange peels! 🍋 It goes on smoothly, rinses off easily, and seems to have an ideal consistency. I have gladly added this vegan product to my daily skincare regimen, and I'd order it again without hesitation. It provides smoothing, hydrating, radiant results and it smells incredibly delightful!",1
Wonderful set of versatile bands at an unbeatable price.,0
"I'm using this XXI vitamin C cream with the firming cream.<br />My face feels smoother, and not breaking out using both of them.<br />This cream is not real  thick, and absorbs well.<br />I use a little light make up and it goes on smooth over this, then use blush.<br /><br />I like this, but not noticing a major difference.<br />I'm a older women.",1

I use lots of sheet masks. Most leave your skin a little sticky when the serum dries. This mask works differently. The sheet locks the moisture in and doesn't leave a sticky residue. It's a great hydration and brightening mask. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,1
"'Tis the season for dry hands! I go through a lot of hand creams in the winter months. This lotion is not too thick, but it's not runny either. It absorbs nicely and doesn't leave behind any greasiness. It has a light, fruity scent that's not overpowering. In fact, I found it to be barely noticeable. It is very moisturizing and leaves my hands soft. I would order this again.",1
"I like the details of the twist-front designs on these stretchy headbands, and all of the fabrics feel soft and lightweight. Each one is easy enough to wash, and they come in a wide range of attractive colors, so I usually leave a couple in my car for unexpected hikes and impromptu workout sessions. They're also great for holding my hair back during morning and evening skincare sessions, so I'd gladly recommend this multicolored variety pack to others!",1
"This exquisite set of six (6) velvet headbands with buttons provides a luxurious and comfortable fit, perfect for both everyday wear and special occasions.",0
great,1
"I was very disappointed when I got this facial scrub. I had assumed it was like other scrubs I use but it wasn't. This is a powder which you need to mix with water to make a paste before you put it on your face. I have a tendency to like to use scrubs in the shower with me, so this extra step doesn't really work for me. As far as the scrubbing factor goes, it's ok. I didn't feel a real smoothing or softening of my skin after use the way I have with others. The biggest plus is the fragrance (i love the smell of oranges). I won't be repurchasing.",1
"I selected this little hair remover/shaver for my wife, to replace a trimmer she had simply worn out over time. This trimmer is a bit different than many of the others I have seen of its type which look more like mascara applicators. After one use, my wife is very pleased with it.<br /><br />This trimmer is similar to a rotary shaver that men use to shave (except one head instead of three) and is similar in size to a glue stick. It runs on a single AA battery and is relatively quiet.<br /><br />After figuring out how to use it, my wife trimmed a single hair and was pleased, and then did something that really surprised me   she used it to dry shave her whole leg. It did a surprisingly good job and actually left her leg smooth, but it took a really long time to finish. This is absolutely not the job for which this little trimmer was designed, but apparently it will work in a pinch.<br /><br />Compared to other trimmers she has used, this one is very gentle and when it's turned on it doesn't sound like it's laboring like some of the others do.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent little hair trimmer, designed for facial hair. It's small, quiet and works well.",1
"I purchased these to see if I could set my mom's hair.  She has fine, thin, short hair and I think these could be fun once in a while for a fluffy set.  Mom is 81.  These are super old school - hoping I can do it with a little foam styling product.",1
"This is a nice room freshener. The fragrance is subtle but lovely and floral. Some fragrances give me a headache if they are too strong but this one does not. I love spraying this in my bedroom. It is also a great fragrance to relax with before falling asleep--no dangerous scented candle needed. It does not help promote sleep for me but it is soothing to my senses. The aroma does not last long--about 15 minutes. I happen to like fragrance, so I do like this linen spray.",1
"These headbands remind of Woodstock and the 60's. They are headbands the flower children would wear. The colors are muted but are perfect for casual wear. The black bands (one beaded and one not) are suitable for both business and casual attire.<br /><br />These are about two inches wide and do feel relatively comfortable on. Note that the beaded bands are a bit bouffanty due to the thickness of the cloth with the extra height of the beads. Unfortunately, these are not my style. If one is in the market for this type of accessory, they are fully functional with a little bit of statement. The cloth is wrapped securely around the outer edge of the band and appears they will last a while. The current price of $16.99 is reasonable for this set.",1
"This spray is really nice. It smells really good, goes on really fine, and does the trick. I will say it feels like you need a lot of it though to get the texture I want. I have a lot of hair, medium thickness. I am comparing to other brands with yucky chemicals so I'm gonna stick with this. Try it!",1
The product comes with a variety of useful tools that are perfect for traveling or those who require a compact set of application tools.,0
"This set of gel nail polishes comes in a nice variety of colors. The brushes seem fairly comparable to other nail polishes. What I really like is that there is a little window on the front of each bottle that shows you the color. I've ordered some gel nail polishes that have no color identification on the bottle and I have had to paint (and tape over) a small dot of polish so I can identify them without opening. Overall, I am pleased with these.",1
"I have really been getting into silicone spatulas/brush sets for applying face creams, bacitracin on a scar, etc. There are two large wands in this package. They are single-sided and have a flat spatula end for applying creams or gels. The opposite side has a ribbed end that is good for washing my face with soap and water or also for applying mask products. However, if the large soft nubs are used, there is more cleaning involved to wash off the mask product. <br /><br />The only reason I rated this 4 stars is because the wand bends too easily. I would have preferred if the arm was a bit stiffer to make it easier to work with and allow me to apply more pressure.<br /><br />Overall, this set is excellent and about 7 inches long. It is soft on my skin, pliable, and long enough to hold on to. <br /><br />The current price of $9.90 comes to a competitively priced $4.95 per wand.",1

"I really like this moisturizer. It's lightweight and creamy. It has a light cucumber scent that I find refreshing. It's a powerhouse at deeply hydrating parched skin. It also locks in moisture to keep skin looking fresh. It contains botanicals that soothe irritated or inflamed skin. It's ideal for those with acne, rosacea or eczema. You can use it as both a day and night cream. I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

"I got the lavender and balsam fir set of soy candles. Each one comes in an 8 ounce tin. The balsam fir is headache producing to me and I hate it. However, the lavender is very nice and a faint lavender scent dissipates throughout my small kitchen when I am burning the candle.<br /><br />Each candle is $20 each at the current price of $39.99. Although they are made with essential oils, I still think that is too much for the set. Unfortunately, only one candle is agreeable to me.",1
"The cuticle oil is so very hydrating. My cuticles (both on my feet and hands) are always dry and cracked and this oil really helped them not only look better but feel so much better! I appreciated the easy roll-on applicator too. The body lotion is a decent lotion. I wouldn't say it is earth-shattering or mind-blowing.. but it does smell really good and the scent isn't too overwhelming or powerful. My grandma is sensitive to powerful scents and she didn't turn her nose up at it so there's that. It is a decent thickness (not too runny or too thick), it absorbed relatively quickly and it makes my skin feel soft. The packaging is over the top, in a bad way. As a eco-minded person, the amount of packaging used was just ridiculous and unnecessary, IMO. My experience doesn't justify the price.. for the amounts you get and the average results are not equal to the price paid. Overall, this is a nice set and gift-worthy, but I probably won't purchase it again.",1
"I have tried many different back brushes including this really good [[ASIN:B08HR2GBHC Kozis brush]] and the buff puff type that lather copiously. However, this one's bristles differ substantially. They are very fine and as soft as a cat's fur.  The soap lathers reasonably well on the bristles and the brush feels great against my skin. It is solidly built. It also has a rope loop to hang up in the shower.<br /><br />The only reason I rated this 4 stars is because the title says this is exfoliating and I do not consider that an attribute of this brush. The bristles are too soft to exfoliate. However, it cleans well and feels great to use. I consider it 5 stars for that purpose.  The current price of $16.99 is on the pricey side but I have no similar brush of this bristle style to compare it to. It is certainly not competitively priced with other back brushes which are about $7 cheaper.",1
"I am in my late 40's and always looking for new skin care products to help reduce the signs of aging, so when I was given the opportunity to purchase this serum at a discounted price in order to try it out, I was more than happy to do so. It is the first face serum that I have tried that has absolutely no scent or fragrance. It's a very thin consistency, like water. It took a couple of uses to figure out that I can't just pump a little bit on to my finger because it just rolls off. The absorption rate is pretty quick which I like. It's frustrating when you have to wait a few minutes for a serum to absorb into you skin so you can continue your skin care routine. I'm a busy mom & don't have a lot of time to just wait around!  I love the list of natural ingredients!!! I've only been using this for a couple of weeks. I'm not seeing any major improvements with my wrinkles and such, but I am noticing an overall improvement in the texture of my skin. I realize that it often takes longer with continued use before some improvements are noticeable. I'm enjoying it & will update my review after continued use.",1

"This is the first time I've ever used a stainless steel version of a gua sha scraper tool, but I've been decidedly pleased with the overall results! I love the super slick, shiny surface of this heart-shaped piece, and it's always cool to the touch at room temperature. It's comfortable to hold, has a very slim profile, and it always immediately provides a relaxing sense of rebalanced alignment. This gua sha tool also comes with a pink polishing cloth and a red leather storage pouch! The snap is secure and reliable, the stitching is straight, and the scraper device fits snugly inside. I'm really pleased with this product overall!",1

"I ordered the orange color. It is very pale and looks attractive in the tube. However, once worn it changed to a light pink on my lips. The moisturizing effects lasted a couple of hours but I personally did not like the look of the resulting color on my lips. Also, at the current price of $18.98, this is very expensive lip balm. Nivea makes colored lip balm that does not change color--so one knows what color they are getting. That lip balm works just as well and is a lot cheaper than this.",1

"I have thick, wavy hair and need a thick brush. Over a decade ago I discovered that boar bristles work best, but finding one I can take with me was a process. I didn't like those with exposed bristles, so there weren't many options. This is the first folding boar-bristle brush I found.<br /><br />The plastic is light and gives the impression that it isn't of the best quality, but it's survived my backpack just fine. This is a portable brush, so using it requires more strokes through my hair, but that's a price I'm not hesitant to pay. It's come in handy for my kids too, who also have the same hair-and-brush combination.",1

"This is a light weight serum. It has a runny, liquidy consistency that's non-greasy. It doesn't leave behind any stickiness or tackiness. There is no scent to it either. It absorbs really fast and immediately hydrates your skin. It leaves a smooth finish. It's non-irritating and doesn't annoy my sensitive skin.",1
"I have very thick hair and when these arrived I attempted to use it to finish a bun. Nope. Thick hair weighs a LOT and this bird nest hair clip just adds more weight and since my bun isn't on top of my head, the clip's weight pushes my bun off the back of my head. I had high hopes for these cute clips, but unfortunately they are a no go for me. I've donated them to my local women's shelter.",1

"There are six blush-colored scrunchies and one white scrunchie. The material is a bit slick so there is a chance these will slip out of the hair. I have medium length hair in the back and they did slip out easily if I pulled on them. I do feel these are elegant and super attractive. If the bride and bridesmaids all have long hair, then these are a good option. I have no idea what these will be priced at but anything more than $10.50 (which would be 1.50 each) is too much.",1
This nail lamp was bought for myself and the girls when we meet up for beauty time!<br />We keep fighting over who is going to use the lamp next so we decided to get a few of them Lol.<br /><br />Now this one in particular I enjoy using because it dries fast plus I don't feel the heat so much like other lamps.

The shampoo does a brilliant job of not only cleansing hair, it cleanses the scalp and washes away buildup leaving hair soft and shiny.  The conditioner detangles, hydrates and adds bounce to even the driest hair.<br /><br />Both have a nice scent though it doesn't last long, at least not in my hair!  Each is easy to work into hair and rinse out as well.  I like to use this duo once a week. I experience no color fading or allergic reactions as I have sensitive skin.  Definitely worth the price and absolutely recommended!",1

"Boy oh boy, does my dry, sensitive skin LOVE LOVE LOVE Higher Education's Goal Digger cucumber creme!  This is a wonderful  lightweight creme packed with important nutrients such as:  cucumber extract, kale, melon, cabbage, ginger and turmeric, to name a few. Together, these ingredients hydrate and soften skin and do so quickly.  The creme applies nicely -a little goes a LONG way. My skin absorbs it very rapidly and it does not leave a greasy/oily feeling.  It has a nice, light, refreshing  cucumber scent.  This creme will not make your wrinkles and fine lines vanish entirely but  will help visibly reduce them.  If you have dry, sensitive skin you're going to want to try this creme. It will do wonders for your skin!",1
"I had never tried anything for my skin consisting of pomegranate, so I was anxious to try this. It actually is an entire skin care regimine containing a cleanser, a toner, a facial cream, an eye cream and overall moisurizers. I actually was quite surprised how well this worked from start to finish. It was nice having an entire skin care routine in one package (instead of me working with various separate products. Fragrance is light and smells almost apple-like (but very light). I particularly like the cleanser and the toner. It also comes in a beautiful gift box so this would make a wonderful gift for someone. I bought another for my mother-in-law and plan to give it to her when we visit next month. Highly recommend!",1

"These bandages have many uses. There are 16 black rolls that are individually wrapped and each roll is 5 yards apiece and 2 inches tall. These self-adhere as the bandage is wrapped around a hand, leg, arm, etc. These stick well. The stretch allows this to be used like kinesiology tape with the exception that one cannot shower with this successfully and each wrap is for one-time use.<br /><br />The entire roll does not have to be used at once as it depends on the amount needed. When used where joints open and close, such as a knee or elbow, the wrap may bunch up in the crease as expected. However, this is perfect to use as a lightweight version of a carpal tunnel brace by wrapping it around a bad wrist, hand, and thumb. It does not stick to my skin nor to a pet's fur, which is wonderful.<br /><br />This is versatile enough to wrap around the handle of a tennis racquet to get a good grip or an umbrella or cane handle. There are just so many useful possibilities besides medical reasons.<br /><br />In summary, because the wraps are two inches wide and are not designed to stick to the skin, it does have a tendency to bunch up if wrapped around a knee or elbow, so it is not perfect for everything. I feel these are great bandages to have in one's medicine cabinet. At the current price of $15.19 ($15.99 minus 5%) it comes to $.95 cents per roll which is on the high side of competitively priced. These are self-adhesive bandages rebranded as tattoo grip tape.",1
"This product does what I need it to do, I just wish it was odorless or had a soft coconut smell. Having my head smell like an orange coffee is offputting. (granted, I did know the smell was described but I was hoping it would be light)",1

"This multicolored variety pack of headbands is so eye-catching, and the entire set has been quite affordably priced! Each headband is lightweight, adorably designed, and universally sized, and the elastic portions along the back feel reliable and secure. The decorative plastic buttons on each side can sustain some pull, so I believe that they're there to optionally provide a resting place for the ear loops of face masks. Regardless, I think all of the patterns are vivid and cute, so I'd gladly recommend these boho hair accessories to others!",1

I have recharged this once now, and so far so good, but this isn't my first purchase.  Whilst it is works, it is a powerful addition to self care.",1
"I recently took the Pinrose fragrance quiz on their website and this was the scent that was recommended for me. It's okay. I don't dislike it. I definitely don't love it. It's a musky floral scent. Floral scented fragrances are not my favorites. I prefer either fruity or sweet. This supposedly has peach notes in it, but I don't detect them. Fragrance is a very personal thing and it can smell differently depending on your body chemistry. I do like the concept of the petals. They're basically scented towelettes. They are fairly dry so you're not dripping in scent. I'm planning on putting some of these in my daughter's Christmas stocking. These are also great for travel!",1
"These hair towel wraps are the softest hair towels that I have ever had. They aren't the typical ""dry"" microfiber material that other hair towels tend to be.  My daughter hair goes past her shoulders a bit whereas mine is about chin length. They wraps work well for both of us. They stay in place well and take a lot of the water out of our wet hair. The towel doesn't get too heavy when wearing it either. I love the variety of colors. These really look nice and come in a gift box. They would make a great gift!",1
"Love these! The bumps on my legs finally gone! I just use on my arms on legs. Also, a great gift for girlfriends!",1
"If you have any level of melanin in your skin, you know the struggle with hyperpigmentation. Any red spot that comes out on my skin eventually turns brown. This moisturizer is deeply hydrating in addition to being a powerful brightener. It helps to get rid of blemishes and dark spots faster than most OTC treatments. Use it twice per day for best results. I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

I like the primer so much that I purchased them for all of my Tréstique lippies, as opposed to balm that comes with the glosses.  It gives your lipstick longevity and allows for fullest pigment payoff!",1

Works great,1
I've had an obsession with gels with my time off from work these past months and I wanted to try this color changing polish.<br />It comes with designs and while the color itself is dark it does change.<br />I am enjoying trying the designs but man it does take practice!!!,1
"I love how easily and quickly  Tinazana's Pineapple Deep Cleanser becomes a creamy lather that feels really nice on my face.  A very small amount of the cleanser does a great job of deeply cleaning pores and removing dead skin cells. My face feels fresh and clean after cleansing. But it does dry out my skin a bit.  Because I follow up using toner and moisturizer, this isn't a huge deal for me and doesn't prevent me from continuing to use Tinazana cleanser.  There is a light, faint, fresh scent that I enjoy. Surprisingly, it doesn't smell like pineapple to me.  It also doesn't last; when I rinse the cleanser off, I can no longer detect the scent at all.<br /><br />Due to skin sensitivity issues, I sometimes have issues with citrus based products. I know pineapple technically isn't a citrus fruit but I was a bit concerned it might be too harsh on my skin. Its not. No burning or itching at all.<br /><br />I like this cleanser a lot. Does a great job, even with drying my skin a bit.  The price is reasonable. This is a cleanser I will continue to use and I recommend it.<br /><br />My overall rating is 4.5 stars.",1
"This deodorant offers a long-lasting, pleasant scent that can be worn daily without any staining concerns.",0
"Sweet orange is one of my favorite essential oils. It immediately makes me feel energized and refreshed. This body wash is the perfect way to start your day. The scent will perk you up and get you moving. The formula is very moisturizing and won't strip your skin. The fragrance is unisex, so it would make a good gift for women and men. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1
Tea tree is one of my favorite essential oils because it has so many uses. It helps acne blemishes to heal quickly. It can be used as a topical antibiotic. You can add it to hair and scalp treatments to promote growth and scalp health. It's also a calming scent when used in a diffuser. You'll probably find more uses for it over time. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,1

"Vitamin C is definitely an essential component of a healthy body and skincare routine, and I love that this smooth cream also contains shea butter, vitamin E oil, rosemary, jojoba oil, aloe vera, cocoa butter, and lavender essential oil. This lotion has a pleasant scent, and it seems to work great with overnight applications. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and moisturized the next morning, and it has even helped diminish the appearance of minor blemishes over time. I love that this product is USDA-certified organic and that it's made in small batches in the USA! The tub comes adequately sealed with a clearly marked expiration date, and I think it's affordably priced for the results it provides. 🌤",1

"This is a beautiful compact mirror with regular and close-up mirrors on the inside. Both mirrors are small but functional. It is fashioned like a pocket watch. The clasp is solid and the finish is high-gloss like the interior mirror itself.<br /><br />The saying (see below) on the outside is nice but the last two words of ""I WIN!"" may be taken wrong; it depends on the girlfriend. <br /><br />TO MY<br /><br />Girlfriend<br /><br />NEVER FORGET THAT<br /><br />I love you<br /><br />THE MOST,<br />I WIN!<br /><br />In summary, this is a lovely gift in a nice gift box. The current price of $22.99 is competitive. I would have given this 5 stars if it were not for the last two words.",1
"I love coffee scrubs. This one is a new favorite. There are two types of body scrubs. Dry ones that are like sand and don't clump together or ones that have a lot of oil that cause it to clump together. This one is a dry one. It comes with a little scoop which is nice. My last dry coffee scrub that I had did not, so it actually was a bit messy to use. The directions say to scrub it on your skin and leave for a few seconds before rinsing. Most coffee scrubs that I have tried say to leave it on for a few minutes which I find to be nearly impossible unless you turn the water off. The smell is amazing - a rich coffee scent that is perfect for slow moving mornings. It does leave behind an ever so slightly oily texture, but it goes away after toweling off and leaves behind soft skin. I haven't noticed any difference in my cellulite, but I have read that caffeine helps with it. I don't use it for the cellulite. I like to use it for exfoliating my skin.",1
"Good buy. Quality toothbrush. Simple to use, easy to replace the brushes when they wera out. Absolutely no complaints. Would use this vendor in the future.",1
This is a very large and heavy dryer.  I am keeping it as I need one right now but would not buy it again.  Hard to handle.  Certainly too large to travel with.,1
The product is a refreshing blend of coconut and sweet almond oils.,0
"This dermaplaning blade offers a precise and efficient way to remove dead skin cells and reveal brighter, smoother skin.",0
"I do like the angle of this dermaplaning blade, other than that, it's basically a razor.  It preforms just like any other razor blade other than the way you hold it.  I can't say it's something special due to this.  The cleaning brush is great and needs to be used since the hair stays in the blades.",1

"A healthy barrier leads to healthy skin. This serum helps to repair your skin's natural barrier, locking in moisture and blocking bacteria and irritants. It contains niacinamide which helps to reduce inflammation and redness. Centella heals skin and makes it more resilient to environmental damage. The serum is fairly lightweight and absorbs quickly.

"I think this is a great set of utilitarian beauty tools! If you've ever tried to apply a goopy face mask with just your fingers (looking at you gold-infused charcoal paste), then you know the struggle that often comes with scooping up products and then trying to spread them evenly before they start to dry in place. These bendy silicone-tipped spatula brush sticks and paddles streamline the entire process!<br /><br />All of the tools are lightweight, easy to clean, and they seem to be fairly durable! I love the candy-colored palette of pastel hues, and the various textures and tips offer plenty of versatility and flexibility. They are also great for hygienically scooping up globs and dollops of various creams and moisturizers that need to be kept as sanitary as possible for repeated applications. I'd definitely recommend this tool set to others!",1
"I LOVE the colors! I have very thick hair so hairbands are almost always snug and this is the same width as most hairbands. Vibrant color. The buttons are placed EXACTLY where you need them. The seller includes extra buttons. The buttons are not removable but when you take the mask off you can flip the hairband so the buttons face inward so you don't see them.  I like the big white buttons, they give me a retro 1940's look.",1
This is much faster and less messy than using the cream. Quick any easy. Not the longest hold but good for a few hours. Not much of any smell to it which is probably better. Some of these wax's are way too fragrant.,1
"I'm in my mid-fifties and I have been using creams targeted to the neck and chest area for a few years now. I have definitely seem some improvement in the texture of that skin. This bottle is very small. It's a lotion consistency and it has a light pleasant scent. It doesn't leave my hands feeling sticky, but the bottle is sticky. I have washed it at least once and it remains sticky. It absorbs quickly. I can't tell if it's doing it's job as I haven't seen any noticeable changes, but it isn't hurting anything either.",1
The product is a fantastic addition to any beauty routine.,0

I've been using this product for a few weeks and I'm really impressed with it.,0
The product offers a pleasant aroma and a pleasant experience.,0
"Absolutely adorable, these charming earrings are the perfect addition to any outfit.",0

"This is a lovely set of three sponges in nice colors of  pink, burgundy, and teal. It also comes with a great metal sponge holder, a silicone brush cleaner, and some cleaning solution. The sponges are light and airy like most sponges like this on the market. <br /><br />The burgundy sponge with the flat side is great for smooth applications. The typical egg-shaped (teal) and the hour-glass (pink) sponges are good for blending or any large make-up application. The hour-glass one is easy to hold in the center.<br /><br />These feel good in the hands, blend reasonably well, and feel soft against my skin. These blenders make a great gift for the make-up obsessed. I love that the sponges do not smell. I tried other colored sponges and they smell like pencil shavings or other chemicals and these do not.<br /><br />I personally do not use a silicone sponge cleaner. I prefer to use my hands and soap and water but having the silicone cleaner with cleaning solution provided is a nice touch.<br /><br />The sponges themselves are similar in style to all of the others that I tried before this. To me what set of sponges to buy all comes down to the price and the angles one wants on the sponges as well as whether it is for gifting or not. The colors are important too--at least to me. <br /><br />The current price of $7.99 is a great deal for this.",1

"This is a nice, light gel cream packed with aloe and hyaluronic acid, 2 things I love to use on my dry, sensitive aging skin. Easy to apply-a little goes a long way. Absorption is fast and does not leave a greasy/stick feel behind.  Instantly hydrates and soothes the red patches of inflammation that plagues my skin.<br /><br />The cream itself if a light blue-ish/grey-ish color but don't worry, it doesn't discolor skin. There is a  bit of a scent that I find to be medicinal though it fades quickly.<br /><br />I do not know if it occurred during shipping (the product shifted) or if its normal but my jar seemed to be missing some cream (see photo). Despite this, its still a good, affordable cream that works well on even the driest of skin.",1

my hair is long.  It took a long time to get these put in.  The curls were great. These rollers would be great for someone who wants to sleep in them. I didn't find it worth it to use during the day.<br /><br />Good curlers with no heat.  I prefer my hot rollers.,1
"I've used sonic toothbrushes before. I like the pink color of this. It comes with a travel case and extra brush heads. There are several different speeds/settings that you can use. As far as I can tell, there isn't a timer on it which would be nice. The bristles are pretty firm. I'm guessing maybe they are a medium. It does a good job of leaving my teeth clean.",1
"Simple, thoughtful design.  Priced right.  I use this to allow brushes to dry after washing.  Works perfectly!",1
Plastic does not bend for matching your brows and will not lay against your skin for tinting at all. The shapes included are way too large and do not match the natural brow lines. Total waste of money.,1
We mostly use essential oils in diffusers with only a little concern for holistic effects.  But we do run peppermint and lavender for stress relief.  We have been very happy with these in the diffuser.  They smell great and come in nice little bottles.  It would be a great little gift set although the box is not overly ornate.  I can't really do better to describe it than to say it is a decent intro set.,1
"This is a nice set of five individually wrapped pink-colored blending sponges all with an angled side. I love the sponges as they are of medium-density.<br /><br />The flat / angled side is great for smooth applications. They feel good in my hands, blend well, and feel soft against my skin. Since these are of medium density, they do not soak up as much foundation as others that are more airy. I also love that the sponges do not smell. I tried other colored sponges and they smell like pencil shavings or other chemicals and these do not.<br /><br />These blenders make a great gift for the make-up obsessed. These would have been perfect as gifts for the Easter Basket or as a stocking stuffer because each comes in their own package EXCEPT for the negative issue I mention below.<br /><br />There is one big negative, however. Each package is marked with a price of $1.55 each. Unfortunately, at the current price of $9.95, it comes to $1.99 per sponge which is $.44 cents more than the price marked. Therefore, I cannot recommend these if they are being used for resale or as stocking stuffers or Easter basket gifts because the price is actually more than it says on the package.",1
"Interesting sunscreen. Has a clear gel  consistency, goes and smooth and easily. Rubs in great and dries quickly, smells first of running alcohol and then berry. Seems to be effective in preventing sunburns.",1
Had originally planned on using this for my feet but given I have some cracks it mentioned not to use on cracked or hurt feet because it could sting and other similar side effects. I am not sure whether to use this product or not because it also mentioned that it is possible that it will sting whether or not you have cracks on your feet or anything similar. I am a little worried if I should use this at all. I am gifting this away because I do not want to hurt my feet. I hope it helps someone else.,1

"This is a lovely set of two sponges but they are not heart shaped. What is heart shaped is the plastic holding the two sponges together with the flat side joining into what almost looks like a heart. Nevertheless, I still love them. The set comes with a great metal sponge holder. The sponges are dense. As a result, make-up does not soak in as easily.<br /><br />Both blenders have a flat side which is great for smooth applications.

"There are two amber glass spray bottles in this set. In addition, four black labels, one stainless steel funnel, one glass eye dropper, one white marker, and two standard black caps are included. It is important to go through all the packaging in order to find these items as I almost missed a few. Note that these are packaged exceptionally well in double bubble wrap sleeves for each bottle.<br /><br />These are perfect for hair solutions, water, window cleaner, vinegar, etc., etc., etc. The spray nozzles, with a turn of the front dial, dispense a wonderful mist spray or a fine stream just like many store bought spray products. Each bottle holds 16 ounces of liquid. The amber color of the glass helps protect light sensitive products. <br /><br />The current price of $18.98 is competitive but somewhat pricey for this set as it comes to $9.50 per bottle not counting the added incidentals.  Their [[ASIN:B08HGZXLP6 four-pack of bottles]] is about $1 cheaper per bottle.",1

Charging time:4-6 Hours. Charging voltage:5V.<br />Cleaning modes are gentle/standard/pulse massage. High pressure water pulse, 20-140PSI water pressure. ** Make sure to not lose the little white tab that covers the charger port - you'll need it to keep it waterproof.",1
"Would not spend money again for this product, there are cheaper ones on market that do the same thing. Item just ok.",1
I love the results of this lotion. It is creamy and not too thin or thick and absorbs easily. I applied this to my face and neck and felt lightly hydrated. It does say there is a UVA/UVB sun filter in this but it does not say what SPF it is. The only other negative is that it took me about one minute to get the product to dispense from the pump bottle on initial use only. Also note the box is four times the width of the product. <br /><br />The current price of $38.40 is pricey for this but it's from France and expected.,1

I did not realize these were not stitctched to appear to be tied,  which I really like- Mommy actually ties it to create a custom fit for their baby's head. Perfect!!! Hope to see more sets, specifically solid colors (pastels, primary colors, neons) My daughter and daughter in law love them.",1
"Somehow, I managed to dodge dark circles under my eyes for most of my life...until a few years ago. Now, they're the 'norm' for me.  Same for puffy eyes. FRLEDM's 24K gold under eyes patches help tackle both issues and do so quickly. I keep the patches in the fridge-I get better results when they're cold and it feels good as well.  I wear the patches in the morning for about 15 minutes and I'm good to go.  It did take multiple uses before the results were obvious but that's to be expected.  I like many of the ingredients in the patches, including: collagen, hyaluronic acid (HUGE fan!), and aloe, to name a few.  I'm not a  fan of the roller, unfortunately.  I just do not care for the way it feels on skin...its not smooth and gentle, more like tugging and pulling.  I will be passing it along to my mom who is anxious to try it.<br /><br />While I'm not a fan of the roller, I am a fan of the patches and am pleased with the results they provide.  I will continue to use the patches and definitely recommend them. I hate to say that I don't recommend the roller just because I don't like the way it feels so I will just say  its not for me.",1
I am quite pleased with my purchase of the DND product.,0

"We discovered Essie nail polish a while ago and it quickly became my partners favorite.  But that was the Gel Couture line which has been known to stand up to entire canoe trips into Minnesota's Boundary Waters.  This is truly good nail polish, but as she says, &#34;this is more for people who do their nails daily or at least don't expect it to last through a hike.&#34;<br /><br />We did like the Let it Glow Pink color, and we like the brand, but they set their own bar high.  This is definitely a good polish, just their other line is better.",1
Rrain hats are incredibly convenient and<br />perfect for those unexpected downpours.,0
Great buy at a great price and they were packed great!,1
This product is excellent and left my skin feeling wonderfully soft.,0
So far this seems to be a good product. It definitely helps rid me of acne scar when used within a combination of other products.,1
Love it,1
"I am finding SO many uses for Shiny Leaf's coconut and sweet almond oil! I do have some experience with coconut oil but this is my first time using sweet almond oil.  Thanks the labels on the bottles, reviews and internet searches, I'm finding SO many ways to use these oils...sometimes together, sometimes individually.<br /><br />Because I have terribly dry, sensitive skin, my main goal was to see how one or both oils could help protect my skin, especially now that winter has arrived and my skin is REALLY taking a beating.  Both oils work well to hydrate and moisturize, so I mixed a few ounces of each in a mist bottle. After I bathe, I mist  a combo of the oils over my skin to help hydrate and moisturize. The oils absorb quickly and do not leave an oily/greasy look OR feel to my skin.  I'm already seeing a decrease in my dry skin/itchy red patches of skin. I experience NO discomfort whatsoever when misting these oils onto my sensitive skin.  Both oils also work wonders on hair by moisturizing, hydrating, improving hair texture/strength, stimulate hair growth /thicken hair, and nourish the scalp to prevent dry, itchy flakes. In addition to using my combo of oils after bathing, I also give my hair a spray or two with the mister and sure enough, I'm seeing less hair in the drain and on my hairbrush after brushing. My hair is soft, smooth and shiny WITHOUT looking or feeling oily/greasy from the oil combo.<br /><br />I use the coconut oil (alone) to help remove makeup, under and around my eyes to soften and reduce fine lines, I rub a small amount into my scalp (as does my husband) to help stimulate hair growth, on the kid's faces after their baths to soften (especially in cold weather!), on my nail beds every couple of days and a light amount on any patches of eczema/red skin.  (It relieves the itching/burning and redness from eczema quickly!)<br /><br />I use the sweet almond oil (alone) on  dark circles under my eyes, a SMALL amount on split ends in my hair, a drop on chapped lips, I'm just starting to tinker with it for aromatherapy purposes.  I recently learned that it can help fade scars so I've begun to rub some sweet almond oil into a scar on my finger to see what happens. If it helps, I'll then move on to a small facial scar I have. I'm also trying something on my own; just started doing this a few days ago.  I get nosebleeds every single day, at least once a day, throughout the winter when the heat is on in the house. This started when I was 2 years old, I'm now 49 so I've experienced this my entire life.  I now rub a small amount of sweet almond oil under my nostrils before bed.  Since starting this, I continue to have nosebleeds. Yesterday, I had only one and it involved just a few drops of blood. I didn't whip through numerous tissues like normal.  ONE tissue took care of it. (that's huge for me!) I have NO clue if its just a coincidence or if the sweet almond oil is helping in any way but I'm going to continue using it.<br /><br />These oils are phenomenal! Both bottles are 16oz.  I love the fact that they have normal caps on them but pumps for each bottle are included as well.  The liquid of each is thinner oil than I expected, which I prefer.  Both absorb quickly. Neither has a scent.  I've found SO many uses for these oils, I can't wait to discover more. ( I'm SO happy with these oils, I recently purchased Shiny Leaf's biotin hair conditioner and cannot wait to try it! ) I find the price to be incredibly reasonable, especially since you're getting TWO bottles of oils! HIGHLY recommended!<br /><br />*FYI...the mist bottle on the end in my photo is NOT included! I used one of my  own mist bottles to combine both oils.  You will get both bottles AND pumps that you see in my photo, NOT the mist sprayer!",1
Great product,1
I thought I would love this headband. It is gorgeous and feels great but the material it is made of is so slippery that it keeps sliding off my hair. It is only for this reason I rated this 2 stars as it is not for me.,1
"The flip top cap has a tab on it that has to be pulled before dispensing this. The cream is very thick and reminds me of Elmer's glue. It is scentless and takes about 30 seconds to absorb. After that the skin is fully hydrated and protected. For the current price of $11.99, this is decent diaper rash cream.",1
Wonderful assortment of vibrant colors.,0

"The product review is repetitive, overly optimistic, and overly generic, with a conclusion that is overly positive.",0
"I've worn this for 3 days, I'm a little disappointed the black paint had already started to chip off.",1
"It's great, feels perfect and does not permit my hair to get wet!",1
"cheap stuff... bumpy surface, paint is chipping off after one use. It's not worth printing a return label, or a drive to ups.",1
I was pleasantly surprised by the exceptional quality of this hair set.,0
"This is a great hair straightener. Heats up quickly and evenly, makes it easy to take the curl out of my naturally wavy hair. It fits easily in my hand and maneuvers around the front and back of my head easily. Does not heat up my countertop (keeps the heat on the iron). I love this pink, too, it matches my decor perfectly. I highly recommend this Bellezza styler.",1
"The shower sponges are just slightly smaller than the average ones sold, however, I'm sure with daily use they will expand fine.  So far, so good.  Sent in a zip-lock style bag to maintain cleanliness, nice touch.  No choice as to colors, but I received two green, two purple and two blue, with a traditional rope loop for hanging. Pleased with purchase, will update once we've used one for a length of time.",1

I am quite impressed with the exceptional holographic quality of this product.,0
Great hair wraps that help dry hair faster than a regular towel. I like the different colors and they seem to be great quality.,1
This compact brush is an excellent addition to any hair care routine.,0
"This set of two roll-on fragrances comes with a PU leather carry case that will hold up to six roll-on fragrances or essential oils. The lemongrass smells as it should and the protector blend smells spicy. Both of the fragrances are strong. The current price of $19.99 ($24.99 minus $5) is competitively priced for this set. Unfortunately, these scents are way too strong for me.",1
"As a curly girl, I'm very familiar with using hair oils. This one is an organic blend of argan oil and shea butter. Both are excellent for hair. You can use this as a shine booster, hot oil treatment, or anything else you choose. You could even try it as an overnight treatment. It's a great product. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1
"The product provided an exceptional experience, leaving my skin feeling incredibly soft.",0
"Despite having a thick-ish, creamy consistency, the conditioner not only dispenses without issue, its also easy to work into/rinse from hair. Does a nice job of protecting color while detangling and softening. However, I don't really notice any added shine or volume.<br /><br /> I'm beyond thrilled to say it has the unique Moroccanoil product scent that not only smells lovely but actually lasts for a decent amount of time; a rarity with my hair!<br /><br />I love Moroccanoil products and while I do like this, its not my favorite in the line.  I have no plans to purchase this in the future, I'll stick with their hydrating conditioner.<br /><br />Overall score is 3.5 stars",1
This product is a great find for those looking to enhance their natural eyelashes without having to resort to extensions or other artificial methods.,0

"Aeroblend is The Best airbrush foundation. It looks just like my natural skin when applied. I purchased my Aeroblend system in November, and it's Wonderful! Since November, I have tried Luminess, Belloccio, and Aeroblend foundations. I had hoped I would like Belloccio because it's half the price, but it could not compare to the Aeroblend Foundation.  The Luminess was too sticky, like it never set. The Aeroblend looks Absolutely Flawless. It takes minutes to do my makeup now, and so many people have asked me about my skin. I am so glad I purchased my Aeroblend system!",1
"A few weeks ago, I tried a different brand of purple conditioner. This was the first time I'd ever used any purple conditioner on my blond hair. After using the other brand, I noticed a subtle change to the brassiness in my hair. While I was satisfied with the results, I also assumed it had done all it could do for my hair.  Tonight, I tried WELLUTION Purple Hair Mask (for blonds).  The mask is easy to apply and it distributes nice  and even on my hair. My hair is thick and shoulder length. It didn't take much mask to cover all of my hair. ( I did put extra mask on my roots/scalp area because I do dye my roots) I let the mask sit on my hair for 10 minutes.  It has a nice scent to it that I very much like. I had no issues rinsing the mask from my hair. It rinsed out without issue. It did not cause my hair to look/feel oily or greasy. I was able to comb it without issue and let it air dry.  When my hair was completely dry it looked and felt nice and soft. My natural waves were present without flyaways.  But...I also noticed my hair was FAR less brassy than it had been.  The change was not subtle the way it was with the first brand I'd tried weeks ago.  This was very noticeable. To say that I""m pleased with this mask is an understatement. Its wonderful.  And I WILL continue to use it as needed.  Blonds, if you're dealing with brassy hair, give this mask a try. I hope it works for you as well as it did for me.",1
"I love this shower cap. It is very attractive and the black and white colors just pop. I have short to medium-length fine curly hair and take a size small in a cap. This fits me perfectly and there is a little more room for more hair if I had it. This is comfortable and does keep my hair dry in the shower. Unfortunately, I hate the way the bow looks on me.<br /><br />The current price of $15.99 is on the high side of competitively priced.",1
"We understand the need for a reliable spray bottle, and this one definitely delivers.",0
"This PHILIPS SONICARE ESSENCE+ TOOTHBRUSH & AIRFLOSS ELECTRIC FLOSSER (Value Bundle) is the real deal.  The sonic toothbrush gets your teeth cleaner than a manual toothbrush, because of the vibrating brush head and the 2-minute timer that tells you when you've brushed long enough.  A nice feature is that the color on the brush head bristles fades to let you know that the brush head is worn out and needs replacing.<br /><br />The electric flosser works really well--maybe not quite as well as string floss, but it's definitely better than poking into gaps between teeth with a toothpick on a handle.  The flosser is good for cleaning under my bridge, which needs to be kept really clean to prevent gum irritation and swelling.",1
This product is a delightful addition to any skincare regimen.,0
"If you're reading this review, you probably already know the anti-aging benefits of collagen. This mask has a high-potency form of collagen along with a special delivery system to help firm your skin. The mask is in two parts, so you can get a better fit than a regular sheet mask. I can't say it performs miracles, but it's definitely worth a try.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1
"This foaming cleanser genuinely provides an oil-free approach to daily acne control. I like that it contains botanical extracts, and it seems to provide a gentle, yet thorough, clean! It's nicely packaged, affordably priced, has a pleasant scent, a 2+ year shelf life, and it always leaves my skin feeling nourished, soft, and smooth. I'd recommend it to others without hesitation!",1

"As a conscientious AI assistant, I would like to emphasize the importance of being discerning when selecting products.",0
I bought a pack of these and loved themso much I immediately bought another pack. They are perfect all around and the price is great!,1
This is rough on the skin.  I don't like it.  Not sure what it's supposed to do.,1
"This is a work of art. It is absolutely gorgeous. It is also a bit heavy and it is fragile. The white flowers appear like they are made of clay. The design is lovely. However, I have short to medium-length fine curly hair and no matter what I do I cannot get this to stay. It immediately wants to fall out. I feel this is best applied by someone who is a stylist and perhaps can affix this with some pins. It is also probably best for someone who has thick long hair than someone with fine hair like me.<br /><br />I love this but am disappointed it does not work for me. Also, this can be used for any elegant occasion and not just by a bride. <br /><br />The current price of $19.99 is competitively priced for this. Note that I ordered the style called ""Silver 1."" However, what is pictured is a lot longer than what I received. Mine is more tightly compacted and half the size and there were no wires I could stretch out. I actually prefer the shorter version but the product shown really should be the one sent even though this is handmade. Therefore, my recommendation is to return the comb if you are not satisfied and if it is not close to the one pictured.",1
"The product works exceptionally well, surpassing expectations and providing outstanding value for its price range.",0

I love the cocoa butter and shea butter. I hear the shea butter up and whip it until it softens.,1
I am pleased to share my experience with this remarkable product.,0
"More narrow than I thought and def flimsy material. Also thought it would stick better but it didn't. After the water starting filling the tub, they started getting lose which defeats the purpose. Total waste of $ for me.",1
"I don't see the fuss with this toothbrush. As was mentioned in other reviews, it is smaller and more lightweight than other rechargeable toothbrushes. But, beyond that, I just don't get i. I stopped using my older Phillips Sonicare to use this for the past two+ weeks. The vibrations on this brush are very small and I find myself pushing the toothbrush into my teeth and scrubbing to be sure they are getting clean. Maybe there is some secret sonic vibration thing going on, but it didn't happen for me. If I didn't actually have to still 'brush my teeth' manually with this electric toothbrush, maybe it would be fine. However, it's not the case. Without manual intervention, my teeth did not feel clean. As an fyi, I stopped using it this morning and went back to my Phillips.",1
I was pleasantly surprised by the exceptional quality of this product.,0
"I sleep better when I wear a sleep mask, so I use them regularly. When I was looking for a new one to replace my worn out one, I was given the opportunity to purchase this one at a discounted price so I could try it out. This is a nice, light weight sleeping mask. I've had one mask before that was super thick & padded, but it was actually more difficult to sleep with. Thicker is not always better! One side is satin and the side that is against your eyes is a soft, velour type fabric. The straps are a nice, thick elastic band which is adjustable with Velcro. I've purchased many sleeping masks which have a thin elastic band that is not adjustable at all. Those eventually get stretched out before the rest of the mask is worn out. This mask does a pretty good job of blocking the majority of the light. A little light can get through the area of the mask around the nose. I don't use ear plugs very often, but it's nice to have them handy when I do need them, so I don't have to fumble around my night stand looking for them.",1
This moisturizer is so yummy! It's light weight but super hydrating! It smells so yummy! I'm really picky and I love the scent! It has great ingredients I just wish they had another option for a bigger bottle 😍🥥🥥🥥💝 I used this moisturizer on my boyfriend's face and mine and we both loved it :),1
This face wash is a wonderful addition to any daily skincare routine.,0
This is super holographic. Love it. Also it dries fast. Obsessed with this color.,1
I appreciate the thoughtful packaging and the elegant golden tassel that adds a touch of sophistication to the design.,0
Seems good but have been too nervous to test it out. Will update once I do.,1
I am so pleased with the quality of this product.,0
"At first when I saw this, I wasn't sure what this. I looked at the reviews (which were mostly positive) and thought I would give it a try. My skepticism was quickly diminished after trying this for just a few days. I typically shower every morning and I have Vitamin C and Retinol that I apply to my face. So, when I got this I put it in the freezer and followed the instructions. So, instead of just applying the serums to my face, I started using this roller along with the serums. After less than a week I noticed much less puffiness around my eyes (and I am prone to that area to have bags and puffiness). I also noticed my skin looking noticeably better overall. I think applying this roller to my skin allows the pores to absorb the serums faster and deeper. I will continue to use this going forward. I am really impressed with the results!",1
We're thrilled to hear that you're enjoying this product!It's great to hear that you've found a serum that works well for your sensitive skin.,0
"I am enjoying this face cream. I find it to be luxurious. It's nice and creamy. The glass jar is very nice. It smells wonderful. It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. I've been using it at nighttime because it is a heavier cream. I haven't noticed any miraculous results, but I am a regular user of anti-aging products, so I like to think that this is just continuing what's already going on.",1
"Every mascara claims to be new and different. This one actually lives up to the hype. The fibers have a novel shape that really makes your lashes POP. If you're not a fan of falsies, this is a great alternative. The formula isn't waterproof, so keep that in mind. I HIGHLY recommend this product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1
The product contains high-quality ingredients and performs exceptionally well.,0
"This is a nice set. It contains a beautiful compact mirror with regular and close-up mirrors on the inside. Both mirrors are small but functional. It is fashioned like a pocket watch. The clasp is solid and the finish is high-gloss like the interior mirror itself.<br /><br />The saying (see below) on the outside of both sides of the mirror is inspirational. It says ""Beautiful girl you can do amazing things.""<br /><br />There is also a small dish for jewelry and a very cheap make-up case all with the same inspirational verse.<br /><br />In summary, this is a nice gift set. The current price of $20.89 ($21.99 minus 5%) is competitive.",1
"I have really been getting into silicone spatulas/brush sets for applying face creams, bacitracin on a scar, etc.  This set includes three colorful and double-side spatulas/scrubbers. Also included are two thin purple silicone pads with finger holders that are great for washing my face.<br /><br />Each double-sided wand has a flat spatula end for applying creams or gels. The opposite side has a ribbed end and another side with larger soft nubs. The nubby side is good for cleaning or also for applying mask products. However, if the large soft nubs are used, there is more cleaning involved to wash off the mask product.<br /><br />The ""egg-shaped"" purple pads are great for scrubbing my face with soap and lathering up. I love the nub that allows me to hold on to this.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent set. These are soft on my skin, pliable, and easy to hold on to. I do wish the wands were just a few inches longer for a better grip. The current price of $13.29 ($13.99 minus 5%) is competitively priced for this set as it comes to $2.66 per item.",1
"There are 12 headbands in this set and practically all of them look a similar shade of pastel pink, purple, and yellow. Only one headband is bold with an emerald green. I would have liked a red, black, and brown in this set. However, this appears to be designed for young girls or ballerinas who would love these colors.<br /><br />I tried these on and the headbands are comfortable and do not squeeze my head. They also stay put. I have a small head so these would probably feed a youngster just fine.<br /><br />The current price of $15.99 comes to a reasonable $1.33 per headband.",1
"This doesn't leave my hair as soft and moisturizing as the mask, but works great.",1

"My feet are so horribly dry and cracked,  they look like funky fish scales.  I was anxious to see if Monikahair's foot peel mask could help.  The process is incredibly easy and requires next to no work.  Prior to starting, I cleaned my feet. ( The lotion for the treatment is already in the socks).  I then placed a plastic 'sock' over each foot and used the tape on each sock to seal them closed.  The instructions say to keep the socks on for 60-90 minutes but I got wrapped up in an episode of 90 Day Fiance and kept them on for 2 hours. lol. The lotion did not cause any issues for me...I have extremely sensitive skin and had no reaction of any kind to the lotion. It did not cause burning/itching, etc.  When the time was up, I removed the socks and cleaned my feet.<br /><br />Here's what happened:<br /><br />Day 1 (the day after I did the treatment)-nothing<br /><br />Day 2-VERY light peeling-more like little 'threads' of skin<br /><br />Day 3-Actual peeling -I was pulling some decent pieces of skin off of both feet<br /><br />Day 4-WOW...BIG pieces of peeling skin! (unfortunately, I had already started to peel off the skin when I remembered to take a picture for this review...the picture does not show just how much peeling had actually taken place)<br /><br />Day 5-Very little peeling-mainly on toes<br /><br />Day 6-Next to no peeling<br /><br />Day 7 & 8-No peeling at all<br /><br />Results:<br /><br />The bottom of my feet are soft and pink with the exception of my heels. Those are my trouble areas. Calluses are very thick and cracked on my heels.  (a million times worse during winter months!) I DID have some progress on my heels but nowhere near the rest of my feet.  I used the scraper (? not sure if that's what it's called) and made a bit of progress.  I wish now that i had wiped some of the lotion directly on my heels when I wore the socks.  When I do my next treatment, I will absolutely rub some lotion directly on my heels when I start.  I'm impressed and thrilled with the results.  Its flip flop season and my feet aren't always pretty to look at.  This foot peel really helped.  I absolutely recommend Monikahair foot peel if your feet are dry and cracked. They're going to look and feel SO much better after using this treatment!

"This is a very nice set of 6 clips, 10 hair ties, and a case. The clips are strong and do hold a generous amount of hair. I like the non-slippery feeling of the clip itself. The ties are ordinary but still functional. The reason I rated this 3 stars is because I also ordered this same set with the blue clips and tan ties. One of the clips in that order broke immediately which tells me these won't last.<br /><br />The current price of $7.19 is reasonable for this set but just be aware that the clips will break easily because the plastic is not that strong.

"These sheet masks are great for dry or dehydrated skin. They're especially good to use in cold or dry weather. The masks contain an extract of oolong tea and hyaluronic acid. Your skin will look dewy and radiant after 10-20 minutes. Make sure the mask is smoothed over your skin. If you have a jade roller, it's nice to use it over the mask to increase absorption. I highly recommend both this mask and the entire product line.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1
"This comes as a set and no matter what I do, the shampoo bottle will not open. This absolutely infuriates me. I was able to open the conditioner.  I removed plastic seal on the top of both bottles and turned as specified on the bottle. I spent 10 minutes trying to open the shampoo. Unless I take a hammer and chisel to it or an exacto knife, I can't use the shampoo.<br /><br />The conditioner is nice and has a subtle fresh aroma but without the pair, this is zero stars to me when I cannot get to the product.",1
"This is a very reasonably priced exfoliator that does a great job of exfoliating and cleansing as well as hydrating and smoothing.  Its packed with antioxidants that are excellent for good skin health.  The instructions says to use 2-4 times a week. I use it twice a week and follow with a good facial moisturizer. I can't say that I experienced a change in my aging skin but I also haven't been using it very long. There is a nice scent that is pretty much gone once the product has been rinsed off.<br /><br />I  have dry, sensitive skin and have no issues using this.",1
"This spray smells amazing, it does claim to be completely natural so I am wondering if it really is since the smell is very well... processed in my opinion, that being said, it does look completely natural it's completely transparent and once you apply it it doesn't feel as sticky as other products I've used before it really gives the hair a very natural look and for having just applied it a few minutes ago my hair feels extremely soft to the touch which gives me a pretty good idea that this is a good hair spray. The presentation is really pretty and looks cute and clean as well. I love it! I just hope it works well in the long run! The only problem I had (completely unrelated to the spray itself) is that they left it at my neighbors door instead.",1

"I am in my early fifties and my morning skincare routine calls for Vitamin C serum. This doesn't smell like most other Vitamin C serums that I have used. It has a neutral scent that doesn't linger. The serum consistency is thick, but runny. It's a bit oily and doesn't absorb quickly. My skin can be sensitive at times, but I didn't have any problems with this. Overall, I like it, but I don't love it.",1

"I have tried several different brands of face wipes. These have to be some of the best ones that I have ever used. They have a wonderful, refreshing scent to them. They are wetter than most wipes I have used which makes them more effective at cleansing the face. The cloths are a good size and pretty soft. They didn't irritate my sensitive skin. The package did rip as I was trying to remove the open sticker, so I have put them inside a plastic baggie so they don't dry out prematurely.",1
"This boxed set of smooth, golden eye mask pairs is totally fabulous! Each pair comes individually packaged, making this collected group of beauty accessories excellent swag-bag additions or party favor gifts! The included serum feels incredibly hydrating and smells absolutely divine. I've used several different brands of similar eye masks, and these are noticeably thicker and more substantial than every other pair I've tried! Even at room temperature, they instantly provide a cooling sensation when applied to the face. They adhere well to skin, but due to their weight and size, they do have a slight tendency to slip downward with gravity. For that reason, I suggest lying flat or reclining while wearing them, so that they stay as close to the lower lash line as possible. Each package still contains some extra serum after the eye masks are removed, so I massage that residual liquid onto my neck for added moisture potential. The combination of hyaluronic acid, collagen, and 24k nanogold particles leaves my under eye area feeling incredibly hydrated and refreshed. Consistent use of this product helps combat fine lines, puffiness, and dark circles over time, so I'm thrilled the whole set is so affordable! I couldn't be more pleased with this product.",1
We recently came across Essie's Gel Couture line and my partner quickly became a fan of it.,0
"There are 9  soft non-shedding make-up brushes in this set. This is a gorgeous set that contains a brush for most uses. There is no fan, eyebrow, or lip brush, however.<br /><br />Each brush comes individually packaged. In fact it is over packaged. The bristles are velvety soft and they do not fall out, which is great. Their soft bristles feel good against my skin and work like many other brushes I tried previously. I particularly LOVE the large blush/foundation brush. I do wish the handles were a tad longer. Nevertheless, the current price of $8.99 is an super reasonable for this set as it comes to $1 per brush.<br /><br />This is a perfect set for the young teenager starting out on her make-up journey.",1
"I read the description and thought this was something different than it was.  I DID get what I ordered, but it is damaged and the package is open, with paint leaking.  I think this happened prior to it being packed for my order because the packing seemed fine between shipper and me. Scared will have bacteria so not using.  Not what I'd hoped to get regardless but cute halloween makeup kit and I assume there are stencils in there somewhere.  I don't want to open it due to obvious paint leaking inside.  Don't trust manufacturing",1
The product line offers a variety of skincare essentials that cater to various needs and concerns.,0
"These medical-grade silicone scar removal sheets are so versatile! Acne scars, burn scars, and post-surgical scars all benefit from the consistent application of this painless product, and I love that it's a viable alternative to topically applied creams and gels. I love that the flexible material comes rolled up like tape, and I appreciate that it can be cut and trimmed into custom shapes and sizes. The chosen flesh tone would likely suit many users, so it at least provides a certain degree of modest skin camouflage.<br /><br />The silicone component brightens, hydrates, moisturizes, softens, and repairs damaged skin, so repeated use truly does seem to make a noticeable difference. Scars slowly start to fade as the skin regeneration process kicks into high gear, and these sheets are actually reusable, washable, flexible, breathable, and easy to apply!",1
"This product review has an overly generic, overly positive style.",0
"This ivory-colored bath mitt comes packaged in a resealable pink pouch, and it's super lightweight! The packaging says it is 100% natural silk, but it does look and feel more like a linen/cotton fabric. Regardless, it's soft enough to be gentle, but just textured enough to provide some noticeable friction for exfoliation! It fits comfortably over my hand, and it's simple enough to grip and hold and air dry after each use. It can be used alone with warm water, but I've used it in combination with several body scrubs and it further works to enhance the gritty benefits of all of my exfoliating sugar and salt concoctions. I'd recommend this natural glove for all skin types, and it can be used in conjunction with bath OR shower time. I'd realistically pay $12-$15 for it, but I'm pleased with its overall performance!",1
We appreciate your detailed review and are glad to hear that the product has met your expectations.,0
"Excellent for treating acne, providing clear and glowing skin.",0

"There's a Chinese actress who attributes her perfect skin to twice-daily sheet masks. After using one per night for several months, I totally believe they work. This mask is the best for hydration. It can be used by all skin types. The sheet is soft and flexible. You can stretch it as needed. I always stretch the eye holes since I have larger eyes. It also prevents the serum from dripping in your eyes. Another tip is to rub the mask on the backs of your hands before throwing it away. That skin needs special care also. The best part about this set is that you get so many masks. You can try using one nightly to see how it changes your skin. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.  I hope the information that I've provided helps make your decision a little easier.",1
The brush is a splendid creation that effectively caters to scalp messaging.,0
"This product is an excellent addition to any kitchen, as its non-slip surface allows for easy mixing and use with both wet and dry dog food.",0
"This product is designed to provide relief and nourishment to those suffering from eczema, rosacea, and psoriasis.",0
Great soap with mild natural scent. Works great on my sensitive skin. Leaves it soft and clean and doesn't dry it out.,1
"4 stars because it pulled my skin off on the sensitive crease on side of my nose.  Just be careful if you have a tough spot upon removing.  You must rewet it if it is sticking too strongly.  I started on that spot and didn't realize it was tearing my skin.  If you follow the instructions, you should have no problem.",1
"This is a nice cordless, travel size waterpik. It has good power for not being a regular waterpik. Some other cordless ones I've tried haven't had the same power. This comes with a variety of tips. Is easy to fill and use. Has different settings and power levels. Charges via a usb cable.",1
"These along with their other scents (I love the blue ones too) are a must. I'm a face mask and product collector, I have so many masks but these are my top sheet masks for sure!!",1
Would buy again.,1
The lavender bath bomb and rose-scented bath bomb and soap bar all emit calming aromas that promote relaxation.,0
"The photo on Amazon must be wrong. This cream is blue and not white. I hate colored creams. However, this goes on clear and was so super hydrating to my face, that I did not mark it down for the color. Note that the box it came in was all smashed and it was almost double the size of the jar. They could have fit almost two jars of this in the box. In addition, the cream in the jar looks half full.<br /><br />I love the results but not the packaging or the color or the jar being half full.<br /><br />The current price of $15.99 for 1.69 fluid ounces is competitive. NOTE THE SIZING (.05 fluid ounces) SPECIFIED ON AMAZON is wrong too.",1
"The product performed flawlessly, meeting all expectations.",0
Easy to use. I suggest using the one you like least first because I messed the first ones up. Make sure not to run any hot water over them for quit some time. Other than that the second patches I used stayed on for about 3 days until I noticed chips.,1
"This was a great product made to be helpful For moisturizing but, also being sensitive enough for use on a newborns skin. The baby i had ordered this for, has a unique combo- half Icelandic and half African… Creating skin mixture that needs very delicate and natural products that still can provide plenty of moisture. This product delivered!!<br /><br />After noticing a few dry spots on baby skin, I did some research on how to re-capture moisture necessary.. my concern was a bit of cradle cap and the use of Emelia's baby bath oil on the scalp. Not only was it very sensitive and user-friendly, it took care of the issue within a few days.. The other concern was the possibility of getting product in babies eyes, if added to the overall bathwater.. of course, I used my best efforts to keep this from happening- but, I found dipping washcloth into the water and wiping off face… Absolutely caused zero problems- I was totally surprised and impressed!!<br /><br />Knowing the African culture needs a bit of moisturizer in skin care as well as hair care… This has covered both needs in just this one product. I'm certain as this newborn grows we may need to adjust course and add more specific hair care regiment. As for now, this is doing just fine- and best of all leaves baby smelling amazing!!<br /><br />So, if looking for a product that is gentle enough to use on a newborn… That has taken the precautions to keep their skin safe… Using only natural products- and has the ability to moisturize and even clear up cradle cap.. just a few drops of this to the bathwater- can handle the trouble spots no problem.. loving it!!",1
Warm weather means unruly hair if you're a curly girl. Headbands are a staple for me. These have a fun tropical feel. They're very soft and stretchy. They should fit most heads. I'd get a couple different sets of these because I like them so much. I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,1
"At the current price of $48, this is insanely expensive. Yes the brush is a beautiful blue, with a fantastic gloss, and looks great, feels nice in my hands, and brushes my fine short to medium curly hair well. However, the brush stinks to high heaven and reminds me of the smell of burning rubber tires. Unfortunately, I cannot use this in this condition because I am extremely sensitive to offensive odors.",1
I'm trying to do a better job with paying as much attention to the ingredients in my skincare as those in my food. This is a great natural cleanser. It's very gentle and is good for sensitive skin. The lactic acid hydrates and gently exfoliates over time. You won't need a science degree to understand the majority of the ingredients. This is a great clean beauty cleanser that I highly recommend.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,1
This product review is a concise and positive evaluation of the product.,0
"I work at home, so I can't get by without wearing a face mask for a good part of the day, but I do wear one if I am going out. I have had issues with some masks not staying over my ears. This is a good way to utilize those masks. The  headband is comfortable and light weight. It has some stretch to it. The buttons are a little loose, so I tightened them before I wore the headband out in public. I found that I had to pay attention to how I was putting it on my head so the buttons were even, otherwise my mask was crooked. It's definitely a helpful item.",1
"Easy to use, long lasting. Love them.",1
"Amazing value for the cost, I highly recommend this product.",0
"I thought these were bath bombs when I ordered them. However, that is not what this is at all. There are 10 tiny balls of compressed flowers wrapped in various colored foils. They can be used as a tea, which is what I use them for, or they can be put in a bath. I have no idea how anyone would use this for baking as per the Amazon title.<br /><br />Nevertheless, all but the purple and red balls have a purely vegetal scent. The purple and red smell flowery. I have used tea balls before and never cared for them but did like how most stayed together. However, these balls expand into many little flower particles that float in the water. If one were to put this in a bath, it would clog the drain unless the flower debris was scooped out with a skimmer.  I used the blue ball to brew into a tea and it was tasteless. I also had to use a strainer and remove the lid on my pot to keep the spout from clogging.<br /><br />Besides the mess and lackluster flavor, there are absolutely no brewing instructions, no information on what tea ball is what flower.  The Amazon site has a list of the flower and the balls but does not show the foil color. It is almost impossible to reconcile that list with what is in front of me.<br /><br />Shame on the vendor for not creating an insert or package label that says what is inside and which tea ball is what flower. I personally do not care for this at all and will probably throw this in the garbage.<br /><br />This is not worth it to me at any price. It is certainly not a bath bomb, I can't see how it can be used for baking, and as a tea it is tasteless and messy. There is no fragrance, so its use as a bath bomb would be for romantic or ambiance purposes only.<br /><br />At the current price of $9.88 for 10 balls it comes to almost $1 per tea ball.",1
I'm having a hard time but maybe it's me😏,1
"I recently tried this product and found it to be rather dry and crumbly, making it difficult to even get on.",0
"This is a large oval brush that comes with a cinch pouch. The handle has a good grip due to the silicone ""sleeve."" <br /><br />The bristles are soft and feel great against my face. Initially, there were just a few bristles that fell out but that seems to have stabilized. I use brushes like these to apply blush. The brush head is quite large and usable only for larger jobs.<br /><br />The current price of $4.99 is excellent for this in my opinion and one of the reasons I rated this 5 stars instead of 4 stars.",1
These eco-friendly soft products truly live up to their name.,0
Great multi pack of bands for a great price. They wash well in the laundry and don't lose any elasticity,1
The polish was quiet thick and did not apply smoothly. I let dry overnight before adding a second coat since it was so thick.,1
It's a perfect product for its intended purpose.,0

"These shiny facial massage cryo sticks chill quickly, and I love that they come packaged within a clear plastic storage case with an instruction card! You can actually hear the anti-freeze/non-toxic liquid gel floating and bobbing around inside each stainless steel spoon/orb, and I love the ergonomic shape of each tool! The brightly colored turquoise handle tips help protect my fingers from the cold, and these futuristic-looking devices sit and balance nicely on various parts of my face! They do a great job of reducing swelling, puffiness, and fluid retention, and I think they'd make an affordable and unique gift for fans of at-home, cold therapy techniques! ☃️",1

"There are six silk scrunchies in this package in different basic colors. They are thin and slinky and are typical of what I expect of silk holders.<br /><br />These hold my hair well but as is expected of silk, can easily slide out. These are best on long hair because the potential to slide off is not as great. I personally prefer velvet scrunchies to these silk ones because they are ""beefier"" looking. However, for those who want the elegance of silk, then this delivers.<br /><br />The current price of $20.79 ($25.99 minus 20%) comes to $3.47 per band which is competitively priced for 100% Mulberry silk items like these.",1
The Real Techniques beauty blender is a fantastic addition to any makeup artist's collection.,0
"I have used various countertop water flossers in the past such as the countertop WaterPik and the [[ASIN:B07HRNGS3Q Truwell Handheld Water Flosser]].  I love the idea of a hand held irrigator and this does work to remove most stuck debris from between the teeth. What is nice about this one over the other handheld I tried, is that there is very little splash back. However, I personally do not like that the reservoir is not removable for drying.<br /><br />IN THE PACKAGE<br />- One reservoir attached to handheld flosser unit<br />- One USB cable (wall adapter NOT included)<br />- One instruction manual<br />- One standard jet nozzle<br />- One orthodontic nozzle (larger brush)<br />- One pocket nozzle (smaller brush)<br />- One tong scraping nozzle (what looks like a spoon)<br /><br />I charged the unit fully before use. The white light on the side blinks when charging and remains steady when it is fully charged. Note the charging port is hidden behind a silicone nub below the grip dots on the top of the unit. Be careful to cover the charging port with this nub when the flosser is in use.<br /><br />There is an on/off switch and a mode switch. The three water pressure modes are soft, standard, and massage can be cycled through using the mode switch prior to turning the unit on. The jet tip (or any of the other three tips) gets inserted into the top. Be careful to make sure it is seated with the notch in the groove as the first time I put it in the hole, I did not have it seated all the way. To eject, press the release button to the left side.<br /><br />The reservoir IS NOT removable. Instead water enters through the small opening on bottom through which one has to fill the unit. I do not like that the reservoir is attached as I have to drain the remaining water out of that hole and leave the door open for drying. Also, the little button through which the water enters can easily break after lots of use. I personally would prefer not to have to use that hole.<br /><br />I held my mouth almost totally closed during use and tried all three modes. I did not have splash back, which was very nice. Splash back is usually typical of almost any type of water flosser so to some extent I was surprised. This flosser does work to dislodge most debris between teeth but not everything because it is not super powerful but is powerful enough. I am also impressed that the manual is relatively well written; kudos to the manufacturer on this. Normally, I feel as if I am reading Pig Latin when I receive products from China or other countries.<br /><br />In summary, my biggest disappointment with this unit is the attached reservoir that prevents me from drying this out easily.",1
The exceptional quality of this exfoliator stands out from the crowd.,0
"This product is of low quality, with a rough surface and paint chipping off after limited use.",0

Very “rusty” color.,1
"These nipple covers aren't perfect in every way, but they do offer some reassuring coverage! I do like that they come in 2 different shapes, and I like that they're super lightweight and easily portable. The satin coverings are soft and smooth, and the light beige hue is an acceptable shade that would complement several skin tones. I will say that the paper backings don't peel off smoothly every time, and the fabric has a slight tendency to wrinkle and ripple, so the covers don't stay completely flat throughout the entire duration of wear. The rippled texture is still somewhat visible under t-shirts, the edges are slightly detectable, and I think I'd have to layer two of them together to really ensure full coverage. I've had no adverse reactions to the adhesive component, they peel off easily, and I even wore a pair while sweating in the summer heat in Texas, and they stayed firmly in place.",1
"""Best shave I've ever had.  Gives me a close shave with no tugging. Better than an electric razor"".<br /><br />That's the first thing my husband had to say after he tested SUPRENT's  Matrix Cutter Head travel kit razor for the first time.  And what a kit this is. A razor handle, 2-blade refills (each with the first of its kind 6 ultra-thin blades total!), a dock to hold the razor and a bottle of shaving foam are included.<br /><br />The handle is sleek and heavy but easy and comfortable to hold.  The head doesn't pivot  but it doesn't need to thanks to the 38.5 degree shaving angle. It glides perfectly along the jaw line and chin areas without missing a spot.<br /><br />The base is heavy-ish and holds the razor well. Doesn't tip or wobble.<br /><br />He's not a fan of the shaving foam. Says he must 'really rub it in' in order for it to foam.  He used it once and switched back to his regular brand.<br /><br />Suprent has really come out with an awesome razor kit. The presentation is gorgeous and the product works exceptionally well.  Without a doubt this is worthy of gift giving.  The price is reasonable.<br /><br />Highly recommended",1
"This is my first scrunchie. I have not had my hair cut in about 9 months because of the pandemic, so my hair has gotten longer than I've worn it in years! I'm in my early 50's and it's a little below my shoulders now. My hair is thick and coarse. It's long enough to wear in a messy bun for the first time in years! The scrunchie is easy to use and holds up my thick hair pretty well. I don't have to readjust it because it's falling. You can feel the coils inside the fabric. I find it fascinating how it works. When I take it off, it shrinks up again. I like it!",1
"I am not sure what a balancing cream is supposed to be. Nevertheless, I applied this to my face and neck (avoiding the eye area). I like the creamy texture and the fragrance is decent. The aroma reminds me a little bit of St. Joseph's aspirin. It did take about ten minutes to absorb fully, but once it did my face and neck felt incredibly hydrated.<br /><br />Note that there are no English instructions on the jar or the box except for the words ""balancing cream."" This is made in Korea and it is written in Korean. If it were not for the Amazon label, no one would know that this is a hydrating face and neck cream. Also, there is no mention of how many ounces this is but I suspect it is about 4 ounces based on the price per ounce listed on Amazon.  The current price of $22.65 is pricey but competitive for this cream. I like it but not enough to order it again.",1
"Excellent value for money, these bands are durable and have a great feel to them.",0

"I have been using Nutra Nail odor-free nail polish remover for well over a year. It is an amazing product, as it has an oil base that is non-drying to the nails. My local Publix is no longer carrying it and I was so thankful to have found it on Amazon. The ""cons"" are that the Amazon display shows two bottles of the product, which is what I expected to receive in my order. E-mail confirmation of my Amazon order is for 4 oz of product, a big disappointment! I hope that Amazon will correct the display so that customers are not expecting two bottles of Nutra Nail Odor-Free Nail Polish Remover!",1
I've been using this product for over 10 years. Never disappoints.,1
"This halo hair extension is simply put, garbage.  Now, you get what you pay for.  And this is a very cheap version.  The faux hair is very shiny and looks literally like bad barbie hair.  It looks WAY better in the photos than in real life.  The color is horrific, in my opinion of course.  The streaks are like paint strips.  And all of that would be one thing - but the worst is that the hair completely fell out!  I had hand fulls of hair strands just trying to put the halo on!  And you might think - well, maybe a little loss is to be expected?  Except this was handfuls and handfuls.  I literally dropped the whole thing right into the trash.  I would say this one is a pass for hair loss alone.  Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest, personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so, to give you a little more info about me, I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out. It's a shame because it did help you see who has been around the longest and who is a trustworthy reviewer.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - over 6,000 reviews posted, those reviews have been viewed well over 50,000 times, including well over 25,000 likes. Bottom line, I pay for all my stuff, just like you do.",1
"I've greatly enjoyed using this organic clover honey face mask! The texture is smooth and dreamy, and it seems to offer me a very nourishing skin treatment every time I use it. It rinses away cleanly after 20-30 minutes of wear, and I also love that this bee-powered skincare product is made in the USA, so I'd definitely recommend it to other consumers in search of a honey-infused facial concoction! Oh, and both the glass jar and paper box are recyclable, so it's an eco-conscious pairing all around. 👍🏽♻️",1

"There is a lot of lotion (3.38 fluid ounces) for the $24 price tag. This lotion is creamy and very hydrating. It also absorbs quickly. Unfortunately, I am not at all crazy about the eucalyptus scent.

Definitely!The sweet scent of this product lingers in the air and fills your senses with a delightful aroma.,0
"I really like these ear swabs. First they come in a large, handy box and are easy to store (will last a long time). Second, they are all organic and good for the environment. Third, they are strong and don't fall apart very easily. I highly recommend these over Q-Tips (which I have used for years).",1
"I do not care for these emery boards. There are 16 to the package and the boards are triple thickness compared to the standard personal-sized ones I am use to. However, the gritty surface on mine started to wear off after a few swipes of my nails over the board. Emery boards in general do not last long; however, the size and thickness coupled with the limited longevity makes me not like these. They do file the nails but they do not last.",1
"This moisturizer is a real gem!It offers a light, refreshing scent with a touch of cucumber that's perfect for hydrating and revitalizing parched skin.",0
The product's design is quite exceptional and provides a good grip for the clippers.,0
"I tried many different make-up remover products and have always been disappointed because they never remove what they say it will remove and I have to use a ton of solution or wipes. However, these surprisingly work. I used this to remove cream eyeshadow and it did a wonderful job. In addition, my lids felt moisturized. Note each cloth is infused with Vitamin E and Aloe.<br /><br />There are 10 (I received 11) individually wrapped disposable cloths in each package. They come loosely packaged in an envelope, so I have to put them in a zip lock bag to store.<br /><br />At the current price of 9.50 ($10 minus 5%), it comes to $.95 cents per remover cloth. I certainly would not make a steady diet of these since they are expensive, but they are perfect for that once-in-awhile situation where one needs to remove their make-up without soap and water. ",1
"I'm a true skincare addict. I really like these holiday sets. They're a good way to try new products. Caudalie is a cult favorite for a reason. Their products are made from the grapes in their vineyards. You get all the benefits of the resveratrol in pretty packaging. This set comes with a moisturizer, serum and foaming cleanser. They come in travel sizes, so it's just enough to decide whether you like them or not. This set is a great value. It makes the perfect gift. As a note, my box was a bit banged up. The products weren't properly glued to the base, so they came out in the shipping package. Other than that, I highly recommend this set.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1

"My daughter and I discovered facial sheet masks over the summer and have become fans of them. They are easy and fun to use. This box of Anti-Aging sheet masks comes with 5 masks. Each mask is individually wrapped. When you open up a mask and remove it from the packing, you see that there are 2 layers. One is the sheet mask which is thin and papery like. The other is a plastic type material. The two layers are together, so I put both of them on my face. The other masks that I have used didn't have this plastic layer. I couldn't get it to lay flat on my skin very well, so I peeled the plastic layer off leaving just the paper one. This was what I was more familiar with. That layer was easy to mold to my face. The mask was very cold which felt refreshing. It's very wet - not to the point of dripping off my face, but enough that you want to spread it around more on the mask as it is on your face. It says to leave it on for 15-20 minutes. I opted for the lesser time because my coffee was ready & I didn't want to wait any longer for it! Then you are supposed to rub any left over &#34;goo&#34; (for a lack of a better word) into you skin. I accidently got a little into my eye, but it didn't burn or sting at all, which surprised me. I have very sensitive eyes and was expecting to feel some pain. I regularly use anti-aging products, plus I have only used one of these sheet masks so far, so I don't notice any difference to my skin, but I would definitely add this to my beauty routine.<br /><br />*I purchased these masks at a reduced price for the purpose of trying out & reviewing. My thoughts & opinions are my own.",1
Normally I like NYX products but not this one. It leaves a funny coating on your eyebrows and pushes them down so much they look thinner than they are.<br />Not worth it.,1

"I enjoy sugar scrubs! They are wonderful for smoothing rough elbows. This one is a small container. I would consider it more of a travel size or sample size. It smells good. It's got a fruity/beachy smell to it. The scrub has a coarse texture which makes it better for exfoliating, yet I didn't have any troubles with it being too rough on my skin. It is very emollient and has a waxy feel to it.  Because of the waxiness, it coats the skin. I used some on my feet and they became a bit slippery on the tile shower floor. I have had some scrubs that leave you feeling super greasy and waxy, but this one is more of a moderate level of greasiness. It definitely softens the skin.",1
The product is quite versatile and suitable for various skin types.,0

"This comes in a one gallon jug. There are two negatives to me. First, the biggest negative is that it takes work to dispense the lotion. Second, this lightweight lotion goes on tacky and takes a few minutes to absorb. Once absorbed, however, it is lightly moisturizing and it leaves my skin soft.<br /><br />This is vegan per the bottle and the lotion is scentless. My favorite lotion is [[ASIN:B09HYPWMKG Ginger Lily Farms Pure Morocco Argan Oil Butter Lotion]]. That is perfect for a massage as well. It has a fragrance and is cruelty-free but not vegan.<br /><br />This is decent but the initial tackiness I dislike. The current price of $54.99 for 128 ounces comes to $.43 per ounce, which is almost double the price of the lotion I love.",1
it's missing bristles and it's splintered on the back! i found one at target for $5.,1
"Should I start my review by telling you how incredibly creamy Easydew Daily face wash is? How it  makes my skin feel great as I'm washing with Easydew and even better after I've rinsed it off? How much I love the scent?<br /><br />Don't worry, I'll tell you everything! This is  my first ever Easydew product. In fact, prior to seeing this face wash in my VINE offers, I'd never even heard of Easydew brand products.  I'm so happy I ordered it.<br /><br />A nice, thin line of the wash dispenses from the tube.  (The tube is very sturdy and durable, for those interested in packaging) Now, the wash starts out like a kind of lotion but it lathers quickly and easily into a light, whipped foam. ( A dime size amount is all I need to sufficiently cover my face/forehead.  ) The whipped foam is SO creamy and it just feels so darn good as I apply it and when its on my face.  IDK if its possible but I swear I can feel it cleaning, hydrating and moisturizing my skin pretty much immediately.  After I rinse with lukewarm water and pat my skin dry with a towel, my skin is soft, smooth, clean and has  a bit of a glow.  It looks and feels so good and healthy. It feels fresh.  And it feels that way long after I've used Easydew.  Easydew leaves my skin feeling like it did when I was younger-before I used makeup, before I spent too much time in the sun unprotected.  It feels revived and I just love that feeling!  Everything about this daily wash is perfect in my book.  It works great and makes my skin look/feel great. The ingredients and what they do for skin is impressive. (I recommend taking a minute to read the info above regarding the ingredients!)  The scent is wonderful (though it vanishes VERY quickly).  And I have no issues using it on my dry, very sensitive skin.  The price is more than reasonable, especially with the results the wash brings and the fact only a small amount is needed when I wash my face.  Easydew is officially  a part of my daily skin care  routine now.  I absolutely recommend Easydew!",1
Very pleased with iron. It makes great curls and can also straighten hair when you want different look,1
"I am very happy with my Marrywindix acrylic organizer! I have limited counter space for my cosmetics and beauty products. Prior to ordering this organizer, I had all of my lipsticks & lip glosses shoved in a small drawer. Because they were over crowded, I had difficulties finding the ones that I wanted when I wanted them. Now I can easily see most of my lip products at a quick glance. The organizer is only 6 inches wide and 4 inches deep, so it doesn't take up a whole lot of counter space. The acrylic is sturdy & solid and is easy to clean. Recently I have been looking at acrylic organizers recently in my local stores and they seem to be over priced! This one is bargain!! My teenage daughter tried to claim this one from me, but since it is such a reasonable price, I will probably just go ahead & order her one, too.<br /><br />****Update - I ended up ordering another style of the Marrywindix acrylic organizer for my daughter. This one has drawers in addition to storage on top for brushes & bottles. She LOVES it! It is very well made and looks great! Each drawer comes with a liner to keep things nice and neat.<br /><br />*I received my acrylic organizer from Marrywindix for the purpose of trying out & reviewing. My thoughts & opinions are my own.",1
"There is one recessed foundation brush in this set along with three blender sponges.<br /><br />The brush is not high quality. I love the unique container as the brush comes out of the tube the same way lipstick does. However, the container is thin and the bristles are only marginally soft and definitely feel synthetic and are shiny. However, there is no shedding. A brush like this is good for travel where it will be used sparingly.<br /><br />The star of this set are the three blender sponges. There are two sponges with a flat side which is great for smooth applications. The other sponge is a typical egg-shaped sponge that is good for blending or any large make-up application. These blenders feel good in the hands, blend well, and feel soft against my skin. They do have a slight smell to them but it is not offensive.<br /><br />The current price of $10.99 for 4 pieces comes to a pricey $2.75 per item. I love the sponges and to me they are five stars; however the brush is 2 stars to me. This brush only makes sense for travel or someone who wants a brush that remains covered and will not soil their other make-up applicators or bag. Note that the packaging is more than double the size of the products within. I can fit three sets of these in the box it came in.",1
These charming hair clips are perfect for anyone seeking a unique and functional accent for their hairstyle.,0
"Really nice small brush. Made well, nice wood made with boar bristle, my son absolutely loves this. It brushes his hair well and keeps him looking his best. This compact size makes it nice to keep in the center console of his car or to take on vacation with him. Highly recommend!",1

I wouldn't recommend these products; they don't function as intended.,0
"There are two body brushes in this package (pastel blue and quartz pink). Each one has a silicone sleeve into which a soft sponge has been inserted. The sleeve has a loop for hanging, nubbs on one side for scrubbing, and various small ridges on the other side for light scrubbing.<br /><br />I used the pink one in my pink bathroom; it matches perfectly. I showered with it and it holds the suds well. I personally like the nubbed side because it is like getting a massage while washing. My favorite bath ""sponge"" is actually a body puff (those with the netting material) because they lather up well. This ""brush"" is now my second favorite. If the suds were prolific with this ""brush"" like the body puffs produce, I would have loved this more than my puffs.<br /><br />The current price of $12.59 ($13.99 minus 10%) is on the pricey side of competitive for this as it comes to $6.30 per body brush.",1

I really love this blush it's super cute ultra kawaii and I personally am a fan of the changing pictures that it comes with so it's awesome I guess I just wished it was eyeshadow instead the sailor moon one is also cute but too expensive in my opinion and the blush is not a big deal but this item is more like collection stuff but it's really worth it if you want a cute gift or just something really cute to stare at :) /play with for a bit.,1

"This bar of facial soap smells wonderful, lathers well, and feels great using EXCEPT the suds sting my eyes. Also, the bar size is like those hotel travel bars. At the current price of $8, that is absolutely insane. I would not expect to purchase this for more than $2 a bar and that is even expensive for this tiny size. In addition to the price, the fact that it stings if one accidentally gets suds in their eye is also a negative.",1
"There are 10 brushes in total and a carry pouch. I really love these brushes. The geometric shape of the handles provide a good surface area for gripping each brush during application. The bristles are soft and they do not fall out of the brush. They feel great against my skin.<br /><br />Based on the Amazon site, these are the brushes in the set. Note that I cropped a photo of the brushes from the site and attached it to my review, so that one can see each brush's use.<br /><br />- powder brush<br />- blush brush<br />- angled contour brush<br />- foundation brush<br />- nasal shadow brush<br />- big eyeshadow brush<br />- small eyeshadow brush<br />- blending brush<br />- eyebrow brush<br />- lip brush<br /><br />In summary, I love that it has more smaller brushes than larger one because they are better for detail/precision applications. The current price of $15.19 ($18.99 minus 20%) comes to $1.27 per brush which I consider reasonable. I also love the color of these brushes as they match my pink bathroom.",1
These are GREAT! Individually packaged in the box. Don't absorb product. Easy product application. Love them!,1

The nail clipper is a perfect size and works just as well on a women or man's nails. The file is nice as well (although I still prefer to use emory boards on mine). I actually bought another one of these to give to my son as a stocking stuffer this last Christmas for him to use at college. Just a nice, quality made kit at a reasonable price.",1

"I've used many Korean face masks before but never a hair mask specifically! I love that the treatments come packaged in individual pouches (which makes them perfect for travel), and I like that they come as a boxed set. After shampooing my hair and brushing it straight, it tucks easily into one of these pre-filled bags, and it's simple enough to squish and massage the conditioning product around. I usually keep one on for a couple of hours, and it seems like the body heat associated with activity and movement helps the essence really penetrate every strand.<br /><br />The attached straps are easy to affix and release, and the product washes out smoothly enough and manages to leave my hair super shiny too! I love that this formula contains a blend of kernel oil, fermented yeast extract, and soybean seeds because they mix nicely with all of the floral notes and botanical aromas! These deep-conditioning treatments seem to work wonders for my color-treated and often heat-styled hair!",1
Impressive variety of products at unbeatable prices.,0
"I must say, this product is exceptional.",0
"This is a beautiful and affordably priced facial set! The Brazilian rose quartz stones are a pale shade of pearlescent pink, and the rose gold hardware is the perfect complement to them! The rollers move silently, as promised, and they don't seem to rust or wear out in any way. The stones are cool to the touch at room temperature, but placing them in the refrigerator (before use) ensures an ultra-chilled experience. I love that the magnetic box lid has instructions printed on the underneath side, and the soft, drawstring pouch is an added bonus! The set even comes with a informational mineral card that provides reassuring details about the quartz pieces featured. Each tool is perfectly nestled within in its own compartmentalized cutout, and the rollers definitely seem to help increase circulation and boost overall skin radiance! This would definitely make a perfect gift set for someone!",1

A balance pH level is important for healthy hair. This conditioner helps to balance your hair's pH level in addition to repairing damage. It's also very hydrating. It has just the right amount of oil to tame curly hair. The scent is fresh and lightly herbaceous. The texture is on the thicker side but not like a deep conditioner. It's a good overall product for all hair types.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,1

"I am in my late 40's and started using anti-aging products a few years ago. Because I have been using products to work on wrinkles and younger looking skin regularly for the past few years, it's difficult to see new results. This eye cream is a nice creamy consistency. I don't notice any smell from it at all. I am able to apply this to the eye area of both of my eyes with just one dispense from the pump. It absorbs nicely into my skin and keeps my delicate eye skin well hydrated. One thing that I especially like is that it doesn't sting my eyes! I have ultra sensitive eyes and if I sweat, make up and skin care products will often get rubbed into my eyes. Some products cause them to sting or burn. We're having a hot summer here in Georgia and even with sweating, I have not had any issues with it stinging or burning. I've had to stop using some of my favorite beauty products in the past for that problem. I'm very happy with this eye cream so far!<br /><br />*I received this for free in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased review. My thoughts &amp; opinions are my own.",1
"Love the way it sticks to the counter! It's a great size for me. I mix all of my dog's food in it, then put it in their individual bowls. I'm going to need this bowl in all different sizes. It's made very well!",1
I pretty much chose this product based on the shout-out to Arrested Development. This is a loose pigment with a super-fine texture. I opened it when a ceiling fan was on and it went flying. You'll want to use this with a mixing medium to make it stick. I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

"I like wearing eye masks such as these. They are refreshing and energizing. I store them in my small beauty refrigerator which makes them even more enjoyable. After wearing them, I felt ready to take on the world! It comes with a little spatula so you can take them out of the jar without touching them. It felt like they were slipping as I wore them, but when I went to the bathroom to remove them, they were still in place where I left them. One thing I like about this type of eye mask is that it's easy to go about your day while wearing them. I didn't have any issues with sensitivity thankfully. My eyes are super sensitive.",1
These fall apart easily...I would not buy again,1
"Sheet masks are my favorite way to give my skin special treatment. You get six masks in this set. Three masks are aloe-based, three have pomegranate extract. Aloe is well known for healing and soothing skin. Pomegranate brightens and plumps. Each mask is soaked in serum. There's enough to cover your neck in what's left in the package. The masks are so juicy that the serum may drip down into your eyes. If you have large eyes, widen the eye holes with your fingers so the top of the hole is at or above your brow. If you refrigerate the masks before application, you'll get the benefit of cooling your skin's temperature and reducing inflammation. I highly recommend this set.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1
This invigorating body wash is a delightful blend of sweet orange and other essential oils that will uplift and refresh your senses while providing skin hydration and nourishment.,0
"This was a lifesaver for our son with an acne issue! Being a 17yr. old boy who was feeling the high school inferiority angst at a time in life thats rough enough.. bc duh, it's High School!! He hoped for a solution to improve his condition and give a boost to his confidence. We ended at a dermatologist who gave us a regiment of:<br />1. wipe the counter clean of all gimmicks/products<br />2. use a dye/scent free soap and water x2 daily<br />3. follow up with clindamycin 1% to dab on larger<br />  trouble spots ONLY..!!<br />So, on our way to where we wanted to go... improvement was ours in leaps and bounds. Then, Covid... Then, the mask mandate!! Soon after we developed a sort of acne/rash on bridge of nose and around mouth 2” due to synthetic material where the mask touches the face. Dr. said mask was compromising the skins ability to breathe and would subside after mandate lifted. Only, attending school x5 days a week 100% fully masked- didn't give skin any reprieve and with no end in sight, I went seeking help for acne irritation.<br /><br />As of now, we're on the 25th day of Geologie's 30 day regiment and I am so grateful we found this product. TBH, I personally didn't realize the extent of red, blotchy and puffiness this irritation had brought his poor skin.. until after using approx. 5 days- when we noticed a decrease in the puffy/red that had gradually appeared. Over the last 2wks- it has been clearing things up a little at a time and things seem less inflamed and aggravated. What I'm most impressed with- this hasn't caused excess breakout like many other products in the past had done and I'm sure it's bc, of the compound. Nor, has it left skin overly dry.. and both of these are huge!! I'm not even sure how it does it, maybe it's witchcraft?! For comparison: a BFF uses Proactiv (as seen on TV!) with her 2 son's for past x3 months and I'm actually surprised the results we had seem similar but, in a lot less time!?<br /><br />The 2 bottles of product are easily identified and instructions are simple easy and straightforward- x1 AM/PM. I applaud the packaging as it doesn't have a feminine vibe, nothing “fu-fu-“ to turn teen boys away from using “girl stuff!” Trust me, I've gone this route before- and it does matter to some! This is a non offensive clean smell and the product itself dissipates/absorbs into the skin easily after application. A few suggestions I have: leave out on bathroom counter to remind one to use daily, use fresh pillowcase every few days to keep any excess bacteria away, wash mask daily if poss. while this mandate applies.. and most of all- keep your hands away! Easier for adults- harder for teens.<br /><br />As with any product there are many factors to it success.. and for obvious reasons. I can't promise it will cure all issues but, I feel confident in saying you can expect improvement (if not extinct..) end results. I'm so happy to have found this and will be looking into the entire product line for future maintenance use. Sorry so long winded.. I wanted to include details for any in a similar situation- I am hoping this info. may be helpful to someone else in need.. Be safe.",1
Easy to use,1
"I am so glad they made a product like this because I can never seem to find the right color to match my skin and I end up with that Foundation the line on my chin with the two different colors. Not only is this product lightweight, it smells nice, plus it blends in with my skin tone almost perfectly. This is definitely going to be my go to Foundation.",1

I purchased the shampoo at CVS several months ago and I absolutely love it. I have fine wavy hair and this shampoo really brings out those curls. I would definitely purchase again. I have not tried their conditioner yet but will some day soon.,1
"I purchased these type sponges before and I find them great to work with. I like to use the flat end to blend and the pointed end to highlight around the eyes or cheeks. I do find liquid foundation sink in a bit so I use these mostly with creams and some powders. Overall, these are just as good as the sponges from several other vendors I have tried in the past and these are competitively priced at the current price of $10.99 for four. I also love the four color variety.",1
"highly recommend this sleek, stylish black product.",0
"I'm loving this!<br />I've been looking for a great serum for fine lines and have tried many. However my skin can be very sensitive so with many that I've tried, I've found that I wake up with puffier than usual eyes and some have even caused significant flaky dryness. Not this one! Have used nightly for a few weeks now and absolutely no issues. Absorbs quickly, nor burning.",1
"The product's pleasant scent filled the air, emanating from its delightful composition.",0
"Made my hair soft again! Not the easiest thing to get on when you have long hair but I managed. Then after the time required I wash my hair and couldn't believe how soft it was. It hasn't been that soft in a long time. So I definitely think it was worth the trouble stuffing all my hair in there and letting it sit plus it doesn't smell the greatest, nor does it smell bad I'm just used to very perfumed shampoos. But I'll definitely be using it again.",1
Hyaluronic acid is really one of the best skincare ingredients to use for hydrated skin. It keeps skin looking dewy and plump. You can add it to your moisturizer or apply it directly.

I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,1

My husband has dry skin that is worsening now that cold weather has arrived and the heat is on in the house on pretty much a regular basis.  I ordered this cream to help moisturize his dry skin as well as  reduce his fine lines as he approaches the 'big 5-0'.  He's not yet noticed a reduction to his fine lines though he hasn't been using the lotion very long but he is pleased with the job its doing to help moisturize his skin.  His skin isn't nearly as dry as it had been so he is experiencing some much needed relief.  He is a fan of the scent and he's happy that the lotion doesn't cause his skin to look or feel oily/greasy.  He's definitely satisfied with this cream and the results he is receiving thus far.,1
"I got this KLAVUU Nourishing Care Lip Sleeping Pack and have been using it nightly for a few weeks now. I have found that it is tasteless, odorless and does give me very soft lips by the next morning. However, it is extremely thick and sticky and it doesn't absorb very well. I apply it right before bed and no matter how careful I am to apply a very small amount I always need to use a tissue to dab the excess off so my lips don't stick to my pillowcase and so lint isn't attracted to and stick to my lips while I sleep. So, even though I have soft lips in the A.M., this is a pass for me.",1
I'm delighted to hear that the product has been effective in minimizing bumps on legs and arms.,0

20 minutes of fragrance nothing more. $30 plus dollars for this!! I wanted Donna Karen cashmere mist but the shipping took too long. Wish now I would've waited.  It does nothing for sweat absolutely nothing!!  It's so small too.,1
"I am sorry I ordered this bag and am very disappointed. It's cheap, flimsy, and holds light items. Items have a tendency of tilting outward in the pockets depending on the size of the item and are at risk of falling out. The detachable clear plastic tote at the bottom is a nice touch, but that is about it. The zippers are sticky.<br /><br />In my opinion this cosmetic / travel organizer will not last at all. My biggest complaint is the hook for hanging. It is not a full-size hanger hook so there are a limited number of places to hang this. It can be hung on a wire shelf with holes (like a shower caddy or closet with wire inserts) but it does not hang on a shower rod or on a closet rod or any rod much thicker than a finger.<br /><br />This cosmetic bag is not even worth consideration in my opinion.",1
Excellent choice for anyone looking for a reliable hair comb.,0
We were impressed with this face oil from Dose of Colors.,0
"I am in my early fifties. I found a multi-step skincare routine a few years ago and I follow it pretty regularly. The final step for both the morning and evening is face oil. For the longest time, I skipped that step because I didn't want my face feeling oily. Plus, it just seemed that it would clog pores and lead to acne. I recently tried a different face oil and found it wasn't a bad step at all. This oil has a nice, essential oil smell to it. The only ingredient that I can detect by smell is the lavender. It's not overpowering, but it is noticeable. The oil absorbs quicker when it's applied to dry skin. I tried it out on the back of my hand and it absorbed nearly right away. When used as the final step in my skincare routine, it took much longer to absorb. It leaves my skin feeling really soft! I haven't had any problems since using it. I personally only use it at nighttime because I don't want my skin looking oily, even for a little while, during the day.",1

The packing list on the product page  lists ""3 x 3 in 1 Grinding Heads"", so I believed it came with 2 replacement heads, The marketing materials show you how to replace the head, however I am unable to find where to obtain them. Hopefully by the time these wear out in a year they will be available.",1
"We are confident that this product will meet your expectations, as it has been thoroughly tested by our team.",0
I wish I loved this. This is a nicely packaged perfume in an attractive bottle with a gold-colored tassel hanging from the side. The scent is neither offensive nor enticing. I can't even describe what it smells like. It is so very subtle but it lasts a few hours.<br /><br />The current price of $44.99 ($49.99 minus $5) is competitively priced for perfume like this but it is not one I would order again as I have to really love it to pay that much.,1
Haven't worn it very long yet so can't comment on longevity but looks great and dried pretty fast.,1
We couldn't agree more!The softness and high quality of these masks are a true treat for your skin.,0
"This lip mask offers a number of benefits, providing both hydration and nourishment to your lips.",0
"Starters, I LOOOOOOOOVE tea tree scent, strong, but not overpowering or nasty in synthetic way.  As conditioner, really liked that the product didn't have greasy or heavy feel as I applied it to my hair.  Nice smoothness after drying, liked the feel,of my hair, but no major fragrance afterwards, which I like.  Treats my scalp in good condition too.",1
"This product is an excellent solution for cleaning pets' feet, especially larger animals with bigger paws.",0
Good product,1
"The product has been thoughtfully crafted with a delightful earthy tea tree scent and a pleasant, gently foaming texture, providing an effective and hygienic clean.",0
"There are four amber glass spray bottles in this set. In addition, six black labels, one stainless steel funnel, one glass eye dropper, one white marker, and four standard black caps are included. It is important to go through all the packaging in order to find these items as I almost missed a few. Note that these are packaged exceptionally well in double bubble wrap sleeves for each bottle.<br /><br />These are perfect for hair solutions, water, window cleaner, vinegar, etc., etc., etc. The spray nozzles, with a turn of the front dial, dispense a wonderful mist spray or a fine stream just like many store bought spray products. Each bottle holds 16 ounces of liquid. The amber color of the glass helps protect light sensitive products. <br /><br />The current price of $33.99 is competitive but somewhat pricey for this set as it comes to $8.50 per bottle not counting the added incidentals. ",1
"I love water cream moisturizers, especially in warmer weather. This one is light as a feather, but provides intense moisture. It leaves skin feeling silky and refreshed. You don't need much, so this jar will last a while. The formula is good for all skin types, but I especially recommend it for oily skin. You can use it both day and night. I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1
"This product is simply over priced. Have no idea how to use it. Claim to have a video, but the web page cannot be found. Thought the tool was at least a more stronger plastic.this same tool can be found at your local hair store for $.59. Iam returning.",1
This product is a delightful addition to any skincare routine.,0

"From my daughter: I usually buy Dove, Pantene or Tresemme shampoo. I haven't tried this particular tresemme before, but I really like it. It works great like the other varieties I have tried. This particular one smells like coconut, but not overly artificial or perfume-y. The shampoo works great, leaves hair clean, but not dried out and the conditioner works perfectly leaving hair soft and manageable but not greasy and weighed down.",1
"This product review was overly generic, overly positive, and focused on the product's advantages rather than drawbacks.",0
Perfect fit and perfect quality.,1
"We have been acquainted with the Essie brand for quite some time now, and it has consistently provided us with high-quality nail polish products.",0
This deodorant has a pleasant scent that lingers for an extended duration.,0
"The directions on the tube of FRESHME's mud mask (pelargonium graveolens) state  those with sensitive skin should use the mud mask once a week. Because I have  sensitive skin that's precisely what  I did.  I also followed the directions that state the mask should be used after bathing or after warming the skin with a towel for 5 minutes.  Perhaps my skin is just too sensitive because I really didn't notice much of a  difference after using this mud mask.  Its on the light, watery side so its easy to apply and doesn't take much to cover my face.  In the 15 minutes it sits on my skin (10-15 recommended per directions) it never entirely dries and I don't experience the feeling of skin tightening at all.  After I rinse it off (it rinses without issue), my skin feels clean but a bit dry. I cannot detect any change to my pores.  This just isn't the mud mask for me. I've discontinued using it and will be giving the rest to my niece over the holidays. My review will be updated if she has better results than I.<br /><br />--photo #1-taken right after I put some mask on my hand<br />--photo#2-taken after mask sat on my hand for 15 minutes (doesn't dry entirely)",1

"It's difficult to find some targeted skincare products in travel sizes. I can usually find cleansers and moisturizers, but serums and eye creams are not so easy to track down. This travel set comes with a foaming cleanser, an eye cream, a serum, and a moisturizer as well as a beauty spritz. I wasn't sure what the spritz was for, so I sprayed it on my face after washing it, kind of like a toner, but later I discovered that it's more of a setting spray. The sizes are typical for travel. They're small and should last up to a week, I'm guessing. The individual products seem to be fine. I've used the foaming cleanser before, but the other items were all new to me. The scents were light and floral. None of the products were irritating. I have sensitive eyes and skin and nothing bothered them. I do think the kit is a bit pricey, but that's not affecting my review.",1
"Unbeatable! The next best thing to going to your dental hygenist daily.  I have been using the same one for 10 years, never needed to buy a new one.  I switch the brush out every 3 months or so.  I can still remember the epic difference between my regular toothbrush and this. a small amount of toothpaste does a great job. Worth Every Penney, do yourself a favor and get one today.",1
This cream is a delightful addition to one's nighttime routine.,0
Beautiful as they look hold your hair all day,1
Decent shampoo. I used it alone without conditioner so I could see how it worked and it seemed to clean my hair well and leave it manageable. The scent is ok as well. While I didn't notice anything negative there wasn't anything that stood out to me to buy it again.,1
These eye masks are fantastic!They offer ultimate relaxation and are a great way to rejuvenate tired eyes.,0
"This review is a positive, yet detailed, depiction of the product.",0
"The product is an excellent addition to any kitchen counter, providing a secure and convenient platform for pet food preparation.",0
"The product performed precisely as expected, with no issues to report.",0
"To be honest, I rarely have used an overnight cream. Typically, my skin care routine is the same morning and night (wash, apply hyalauronic serum, and some kind of moistutrizer). So, when I saw this Iryasa cream I wanted to try it. Easy to apply, you can immediately feel the moisture starting to work. I do apply this about 30 minutes before I actually go to sleep to allow it time to be absorbed (before putting my face on my pillow) as it is a thicker type of cream and needs time. My skin in the morning feels better than ever. Soft and supple, I definitely feel a difference after using this for over 2 weeks now. I highly recommend this cream for women and men.",1

"FINALLY!! Hair scrunchies that will not only hold my thick, medium length hair in a ponytail but will also STAY in my hair! I am so tired of scrunchies that fall out of my hair. Seriously. But I got these and they stay put! I am SO happy that I don't have to mess with a falling ponytail all the time anymore! The colors are very nice and the elastic is the best I've ever found in a scrunchie. I will be buying more in other colors!!",1
The product review AI offers a brief yet positive evaluation of the product.,0
"Recently purchased the InnoGear Storage Organizer for my household needs, and I'm incredibly impressed with its long-lasting quality.",0
I got these because I have tiny wrists and the originals were annoying when I was typing and didn't have my hair up.  They work just as well and are half the thickness.,1
"The colors and design of these 12 headbands are super attractive. They are all double banded and most have a ""knot"" in the middle that can be worn in the center of the head or at the base of the neck. I personally do not like knots in my headbands but these are versatile enough to position the knot away from the forehead  without losing the good look of the band.<br /><br />The colors are great and there is a design for almost every outfit.<br /><br />Also, the current price of $18.99  comes to a reasonable $1.58 per band. These are definitely pretty and functional and they fit well. There was only one where the material was a hair looser on one side than the other for the top part of the double band. All the others were sewn perfectly.",1
Excellent choice for eco-conscious consumers.,0

"I have been using jade rollers for the past few months. This is my third one. The first one that I bought was much larger than this and I found it to be a bit awkward at times. Plus the end that rolls around the eyes was a static piece, not a roller. Then I tried a smaller one more recently. It was fine, until the eye roller piece broke off. The metal piece that holds it in never felt really sturdy and when it broke, I wasn't really surprised. This one is the nicest one I've tried. It's a great quality and very sturdy. The size is perfect. The directions say to chill it in the refrigerator, but I have found that it's usually cold enough just leaving it out on my bathroom counter. I use it primarily to help my serums and creams absorb into my skin better. This comes with another tool, a Gua Sha, which I was unfamiliar with. They both were in a nice drawstring bag and would be perfect for gift giving.",1
"I love this combo package, particularly the flosser. This makes a great gift package for someone you love, giving them everything they need to keep their mouth/gum health optimal. I have had issues (particularly gums) for the past 5 years. No ones fault but my own for not taking care of my mouth the way I should have all these years. This flosser is great. I fill it with Act Restoring mouthwash and use it after brushing. It amazes me how much stuff this flosser removes with a simple puff of air. Of course, you can purchase both these items separately, but you save in getting them together. Sonicare  makes the best tooth/gum care products on the market bar none!",1
"Amazing product, highly recommended!
Final Verdict: Excellent choice for anyone seeking quality and performance.",0
These are so popular and I was excited to try but I don't feel like it did it for me. It was hard to get down to my scalp and move around. Felt much easier to just use my fingers. Maybe I need to practice more of try a different massager. They seem well made though and look just like the picture.,1
"I love this hair bun maker, it is the easiest one I have used!",1
This is perfect for my between salon visits. I have been using this now twice a week for over a month and I absolutely love it! My skin looks amazing and feels super smooth and silky. This is also super easy to use (just follow instructions). I can see already that I will begin expanding the time between visits which will definitely help me save money in the long run. Highly recommend!,1
"This is the 3rd peel foot mask that I have tried. The others have been unsuccessful. Still wanting to experience the foot peel, I tried again. The first thing that makes this foot peel better than the others is the foot slippers. The slippers are actually a medium thickness plastic. They remind me of the “rubber pants” that my little boy wore over his training underwear when he was 2 years old. These slippers also fit the best of the three that I have tried. I had problems with using the tape, but because my feet are on the larger end, they stayed in place well without it. I wear a size 10 W shoe and these fit my feet fine. They were not too tight nor did I have to stretch them to get them on. They were a little confusing to figure out. The directions said to “cut on the dotted line” but I couldn't see any dotted line. The 2 slippers were attached together at the top. So I cut them apart and then I had to snip a little off the top to open up where my foot was to go inside. This foot peel has a somewhat pleasant scent. I was worried because one of the ingredients is vinegar and another is fermented milk. Those did not sound appealing at all. However, what I smelled was a combination of the ginger and the chamomile. The hardest thing about this whole process was carving out the time to do it. You have to soak your feet for 15-30 minutes before hand. Then you have to wear the foot booties for 70-90 minutes. Then soak for another 15 minutes afterwards. I'm a busy mom, so it's hard to find that much free time. I've just started noticing some peeling, so already it's looking more successful than the other ones that I've tried.<br /><br />*I purchased these at a discounted price in exchange for my honest & unbiased review. My thoughts & opinions are my own.",1
I bought this for a great nice for a gift and she loved it. Smell fantastic as well as moisturizing? Great price!,1
"With winter approaching, it's time to start thinking about cold-weather skincare. This moisturizer is a good choice because it's a blend of several skin-loving oils like argan, coconut and macadamia. It's fairly lightweight but it protects and hydrates like a heavier cream. It can be used both day and night. The packaging is pretty enough for display. It can be used by all skin types. I highly recommend this product and the entire line from this brand.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1
"I love the tines on this long and short detangling comb.The only thing I do not like is the thin handle. I would have preferred a thick silicone handle so that I could get a better grip. The tines are strong and the spacing allows it to work very well BUT there are issues. <br /><br />I have three long-haired cats and unfortunately, my cats do no like this as it really pulls at their hair. Therefore, I have mixed feelings about this comb. On one hand, it detangles and gets out a lot of hair but on the other, my cats want to bite me when using it. I love how it works but not their response.",1
"Don't recommend. No your nails don't look acrylic. Yes they look plastic, thin, and fake.",1
"The product has received mostly positive feedback from customers, with many noting its moisturizing effects and attractive color.",0
Not good for getting out tangles,1
"This is a really nice moisturizing lotion. It goes on lightly and is readily absorbed into my skin. My skin feels amazingly softer and smoother and allows for a nice base for my makeup to be applied over. You only need a small pea sized amount to cover your entire face and neck. Highly recommend for all skin types, ages and for women as well as men.",1
We're glad to hear that you found exactly what you were looking for!Our product is indeed top-notch and should meet all your expectations.,0
"This lightweight moisturizer provides a silky, non-greasy feel for the skin.",0
"If you're over 35, this serum is a must. It contains two powerful skin-saving ingredients. Vitamin C keeps skin bright and radiant. It protects skin from UV damage. It boosts collagen production and helps fade dark spots quickly. Hyaluronic acid helps your skin draw moisture from the environment. It reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It's hard to find a high quality organic serum like this. I highly recommend this serum and the brand.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1
"I have been using these clips for a while now, and they have been a great addition to my hair accessories collection.",0
This product is a fantastic find.,0
Native makes some of the best natural deodorants on the market. They're just as effective as the drugstore brands. I like this set because you get three different scents. My favorite is the peony. The scents are all fresh and light. They won't clash with other fragrances you wear. This set is perfect for gifting. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,1
"I can honestly say that this was the first time I've ever applied a sheet mask to my behind, but I'm always up for testing out new and inventive skincare items! Each product pouch contains plenty of hydrating essence, and each of the two included sheet masks folds out to make a quarter moon shape. It is definitely a bit challenging to try and place them by yourself, since it requires trying to twist your body around to see a mirror, but they'd be super easy to “seat” properly if you had an extra hand.<br /><br />I will say that they do cling fairly well, and the essence feels nourishing, but the sheets ripple quickly with minor motions or movement. If you're standing when you place them and then lie down on your stomach, they shift around and lose some of their clinging magnetism, causing little ridges and ripples in the cloth that are no longer in firm contact with the skin. Upon removal, the remaining liquid essence does easily absorb, so I didn't experience any post-use stickiness or unpleasant residue, but I'm not entirely convinced the panthenol is a wonder ingredient.<br /><br />I'm sure the amino acid solution does firm, tone, and moisturize the skin to a certain degree, but it's hard to really ascertain that after just one application, and since each pouch contains just one pair of treatment sheets, more of them would be required to determine if any noticeable benefits accumulated over time. Overall, I think this is an intriguing novelty item that many consumers might find humorous, so for that reason alone, I think it's worth giving these a try!",1

"I absolutely love this dual-headed face roller!! It's gorgeously colored, easy to hold, attractively packaged, and competitively priced. I especially love using it after I've cleansed my skin and applied moisturizer, right before I start putting on my makeup. It instantly helps depuff my skin, and it seems to enhance the smooth coverage of every cream and foundation I use immediately afterwards. It has definitely become part of my daily skincare routine, and the aluminum alloy rollers are super smooth and manage to apply the perfect amount of weighted pressure!",1

"This comb is just beautiful and the quality is exceptional. It is also hefty. As a statement piece it gets 5 stars. However, I find it difficult to comb through my hair using this. I have short-to-medium-length fine curly hair and the tines are so thick on this, that it makes it difficult to pull the comb through my hair. If I had an easier time of it, this would have gotten 5 stars.<br /><br />The current price of $6.98 is reasonable for this.",1

"From my daughter: I like that you can use this product in a variety of ways, when hair is wet as a leave in conditioner, when hair is dry to protect it from heat styling or after it is styled to add shine. I put some on my hair after I straightened it and it seemed to work well to tame frizz and add shine. It has a light scent that isn't overpowering.",1

"I have tried and tested many rollers and scrapers recently, so I inspected this duo closely. The gold hardware on this dual-ended roller seems reliably attached, and both ends roll freely, but the larger end does seem to have a small issue that causes it to bump with each revolution, preventing the rolling motion from being completely smooth and silent. That being said, it still adequately applies smooth and even pressure to the face with each systematic use!<br /><br />The gua sha scraper exhibits some scattered scuffs and scrapes, and the edges and “v” angle have some rough, white areas they don't look perfectly polished, but all natural stones have imperfections to some degree. This set comes attractively packaged, and it seems to be affordably priced, so it might be a great choice for consumers looking for a starter facial set!",1
"I apply body lotion every morning and night. This one is a thinner lotion than some, but it absorbs quickly. My skin just drinks it up! It's non-greasy and has a light, pleasant scent to it. The bottle is a little oddly shaped. It's thin and flat which makes it a little difficult to grip in my opinion.",1
Love the colors and the fact it's many of them!,1

Work great.  Fair price.,1
The current price of $7.27 ($10.39 minus 30% off) is a reasonable price for these sponges.<br /><br />This set of six sponges are as good as all other blending sponges of this type that I tried before. One has a flat side for a smoother application. The pointed ends are good for more precision. They feel good in the hands and blend well and also wash well with soap. To me what set of sponges to buy all comes down to the price and the angles one wants on the sponges.,1
"There are four individually packaged 2.53 fluid ounce tubes of moisturizer in this set. They are all the same tubes. This moisturizer is lightweight and is mildly hydrating. It absorbs quickly and is a good product to use in the summer. I also like the fresh cucumber-like aroma.  I did, however, expect this to be more hydrating than it is. It is a decent cream but not excellent.<br /><br />The current price of $15.00 comes to a reasonably priced $3.75 per tube.",1

I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1
"Even though this is baby lotion, I got this for me. This moisturizer is lightweight, slightly creamy, absorbs rapidly, and leaves my skin moderately hydrated. Since it is lightweight, it is a perfect summer lotion. To my senses, it has a mild lemony fragrance even though that is not listed in the ingredients. This is made of all plant-based ingredients (see photo). The current price of $16 is competitive but pricey for this 6.7 ounce tube.",1
"I used this on my three long-haired cats and it picked up some hair. Since the surface area of the brush is small, there is not much hair that is picked up compared to other brushes. Also, I tried several of these types of brushes and this one is not as easy to clean as the others. The way this is supposed to work is to retract the bristles with the button and the hair that remains on top can be slid off. Since the tines do not retract fully on the top part of the brush, the hair does not slide off easily. Instead, I have to pick it off.<br /><br />Note that this is for long-haired pets only; I would not use this with a pet with short hair. I have three long-haired cats and even though this works some, I am not impressed for the two reasons I mentioned above. My favorite brush like this is [[ASIN:B09RH8FMMS this one]].<br /><br />The current price of $20.99 is outrageous for this as it is about $10 to $12 more than others of better or similar quality.",1
"Excellent value for your money, highly recommended!
Final Verdict: A fantastic choice for anyone looking to enhance their collection.",0
"This scrunchie is a fantastic addition to any hairstyle, especially for those with thicker hair.",0

(Naturally, it recently happened right after I cleaned and mopped the house! lol)  I ordered the Mr. Ros automatic cleaner for small/medium dogs. Its very sturdy and durable, not at all flimsy.  Its roughly 8""tall  and has a removable mat with silicone bristles in the interior which is easily removable for cleaning purposes.  The bristles are very soft and not at all hard or sharp. It arrived already charged. A USB cord is included. To operate, simply add water to the washer-(2-3 cups per instructions) Liquid soap may be added as well. (I didn't use soap) Turn the washer on-it does make noise though its  not terribly loud at all-and place the dog's paw in the washer for 1-2 minutes. Dry each paw with a towel after cleaning. Mac wasn't thrilled throughout the cleaning process but he also wasn't really scared by it. My husband started to pour out the dirty water before I could stop him so you won't see much,  but you can see in my photo the water is discolored a bit following the cleaning.  If a wet towel isn't enough to clean Mac's muddy/dirty paws, my regular cleaning method is to put some lukewarm water in a small bowl , dunk each paw one at a time and use my hand to remove the dirt from his fur while submerged. Quite honestly, I really don't see much of a difference between that cleaning method and the Dr. Ros paw washer. Perhaps results vary depending on the breed of dog but for our bichon, I really don't see a  difference.",1

A good hand cream is essential. This one is excellent. It is thick and creamy. It's very moisturizing and is packed with skin-loving botanicals. It's fragrance-free in case you have allergies or just prefer the unscented option. This is a high-quality hand cream that's great to keep in your bag.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

nothing special  unfortunately i waited too long to return them ....  no results at all  dont waste your money,1
"So, for a man who thinks his looks strike a resemblance to that of Anderson Cooper.. (bc, of the devilishly handsome silver fox short crew cut) mixed with a longer (3/4”) faux-hawk frontal vibe.. this is a great product to work with this style as it complements the cut really well! As one who's always used hair gel (daily x30+ yrs!) it's hard to find one we have not tried. Bold Men casual- sold just under $20 for 3.3oz. Is a higher price point so, the expectations were high and happy to say, this came through impressively.<br /><br />This gel has an ability to last thru the day without becoming razor sharp quills nor, a crusty-crumbly flake after a full day of wear in tear. Being one who prefers a touchable hold (the hardest combo to find btw!!) this gives that to you.. We found, unlike cheaper store bought brands- less is more! (too much will weigh down the hair) **A trick of the trade for any who want to accomplish short spikes- use less product!!<br /><br />Best results came from using no more than  a nickel size amount onto towel (50%) dried hair.. and finger combing into place. The hold stays movably put.. performing better then ever expected- yay!! TBH, this may take getting used too.. IF, you're norm is the “frozen gel look!” Hack: one can finger style hair into place with this- then, use blow dryer on a lower setting for just a moment.. it will expedite the setting process- giving specific direction to the final look. (A convertible would do the same but.. not sure It's feasible in winter ha ha!)<br /><br />Product is thick yet, offers just enough slip to give you pliability to style before it settles. Note: color is clear… It's just the container that is black! After hair is set, this absorbs vs. shellacs to the hair- letting hair have movement and touchable texture.. The scent is nice with a masculine appeal And after 3wks. of daily application we've used approx. a tad over 1/4 of content (to give you an idea how long it will last..) thus far, washing daily we've noticed no unwanted build up.. which is also a big deal- as this can lead to flakes/Dandruff..!! A good shampoo scrub removes product easily enough.. and paired with daily conditioner, it's not over-drying to the hair. Making the $ seem worth all the quality benefits.<br /><br />This is a top quality higher end product that best fits those who have a moveable set style they like their hair to maintain throughout the day.. this can achieve the desired look and look fantastic- and does so, without all the unwanted side effects that can come with daily use of hair gel.. I hope this info can help your decision… Feel free to let me know!",1

"A few months ago I got a vanity mirror that magnifies 5 times. Until then, I didn't know that I had a blackhead problem. I don't always have blackheads, so I don't use this every morning. But when I do notice blackheads, I use this for a few days until they are gone. The product is white and has a very fine grit to it. The grit scrubs away the blackheads. It does not hurt or irritate my skin. It doesn't take a lot for each use so it should last a while.",1
"I was delighted to review these products, as they performed wonderfully and exceeded my expectations.",0
I'm a BIG wet nap fan.  Always have been.  They smell good.  They are just the right size.  I carry them every where.  They don't leak like a bottle of hand santizer and fit in any pocket.  1000?  Yeah.  It's alot...but I'm happy to use them freely.  And quit looking for ways to pocket them at a restaurant.  :)  They arrived quickly (I have prime) and in very good shape!,1
Love the colors,1
It's like having your own Aloe plant in a bottle because the first ingredient is Aloe. We do have an Aloe plant in our home.  The bonus is the vitamin E and Hyaluronic Acid (improves skin elasticity). This works great on sunburn!!!<br /><br />In a pinch you can use this and mix with isopropyl alcohol (30/70 mix) and make hand sanitizer.<br /><br />This really well packaged to prevent leakage in transit and you can reuse it to keep little fingers from depressing the product.,1

"If you find yourself reaching for lip balm throughout the day, you may want to upgrade to a lip mask. It works either at night or during the day. This one has a light vanilla scent that can be used by anyone. It doesn't just coat your lips. It actually nourishes and gently exfoliates. A little goes a long way. It makes a good base for other lip products. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.  I hope the information that I've provided helps make your decision a little easier.",1

The stainless steel cup seems well-constructed and nicely sized, and the various tools and bottle openers are an appreciated bonus.

I think this grouped assortment offers a nice variety of different and relaxing products that most customers would enjoy!",1

"I am in my early fifties. I have been using anti-aging products for the past several years. This eye cream has minimal smell to it. The consistency is a thin cream. It's not runny, it's just not thick. I have sensitive eyes and this is non-irritating. My eyes water a lot and that often leads to product getting into my eyes and causing stinging and or burning in the eye area. This cream has not bothered me at all. I haven't noticed any difference in the appearance of the skin around my eye, but because I am a regular user of similar products, I really wouldn't expect to see anything new or different. It does seem to hydrate the delicate skin area.",1
"This clip is gorgeous. If one looks at it quickly, it can easily be mistaken for a tarantula due to the black claws and sort of fuzzy looking applique.<br /><br />I have short to medium fine curly hair and my hair is long enough in the back to use this clip. It holds on to my hair well and looks great. The only negative is that a couple of the beads are loose on the applique. This not only makes noise (i.e. rattles) but creates a situation where they can accidentally be pulled off if the ""plastic"" thread holding it loosely hooks onto something.<br /><br />The current price of $11.99 is pricey for this but typical for a $1.50 clip that is all dressed up.",1
"The product's versatile colors and functional design, along with its affordable price, make it an excellent addition to any wardrobe.",0
"This is a lovely blender sponge. I love that this is dense because it does not absorb liquid foundation as some other less dense sponges I tried previously<br /><br />What attracted me to this the most are the angles.The two flat sides are great for smooth applications. The tip is great for more precision, such as around the eye. The round ends are good for blending or any large make-up application.<br /><br />This feels good to hold, blends well, and feels soft against my skin.  Also, the sponge does not smell.<br /><br />In summary, this blender makes a great gift for the make-up obsessed. The only reason I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price. The current price of $7.50 is on the pricey side. I tried other blenders of this quality that sell for less than half this price when purchased in a pack of three or more. For instance this [[ASIN:B08QCJ3DF7 set]] currently sells for $2.50 per sponge as there are 4 sponges for $9.99. Even though all the angles are not in one sponge, the functionality is still there and they are dense, which I like.",1

"I try to get Keratin treatments every 3 months, but honestly it has been getting costly. So, when I saw this I was excited to try it. I found it difficult to use and almost impossible to get to saturate the back of my hair and straight iron it the way they do in the salon. Front and sides were ok, but I couldn't maneuver the back to get it straight. Then I saw the ingredients after the first time and saw it contained formaldehyde and that was the last time I used the actual treatment. I did, however, use the shampoo and conditioner (and I still am). I wish they sold the S&C separate because I really did like it and I am always in the market for a good hair wash which won't strip my hair between treatments. I will resume my regular treatments at my salon.",1
"I have for years dealt with dry, cracked heels, and I have tried a number of things to correct the issue. While my heels haven't hurt or anything, they have been ugly. In a search for solutions, I found this foot scrubber and decided it was likely going to work better for me than a foot rasp, and I ordered it. It's a great tool and it works well, though I do offer some caution for those who haven't worked with a foot scrubber or rasp in the past.<br /><br />This is an odd-looking instrument, vaguely similar to a comma in shape. The scraping side somewhat resembles a mirror with a patterned rough edge. It feels a lot like an emery board though it has more of a “bite” to the surface, if that makes sense. The overall size and shape make it easy to grip and hold, even when wet.<br /><br />The first time I used it, I scraped away a fairly large amount of dead skin, to the point that I had feeling in parts of my heels where I have had no feeling for quite some time. It left my heels soft, pink and looking much better. However, I did discover that one can overdo, and I had nicked myself on each heel in one or two places, just enough to require blotting but not enough to really be a concern (it was less serious than a cut while shaving).<br /><br />I discovered the following day what happens when you remove too much dead skin and don't put enough lotion on an area that deals with weight and stress   my heels split in a couple of places and I ended up having difficulty walking without pain for a couple of days. I had put high-quality lotion on my heels, but apparently not enough. That was entirely my mistake, and it was a painful one.<br /><br />After that finally healed up, I tried again. I have fallen into a daily routine where I gently scrub my heels for a couple of minutes each, then apply lotion. My heels now look much better, they're not splitting when I put weight on them, and I have avoided nicking myself. At least in my case this is not a tool that gets used intensely every couple of weeks, but rather it is a daily tool that gets used very gently.<br /><br />I got curious and put this tool under a digital microscope to see what the rough surface looked like. The roughness resembles a series of crescents, not dissimilar to a rasp, but much more fine.<br /><br />This thing really works and it does a good job. It's slightly more expensive than the average foot rasp but it seems to work well. I do recommend using some caution when working with this instrument as it is possible to overdo if not careful, which is probably very true of any tool of this type.",1
The product's simple yet elegant design caters to both professional and amateur users alike.,0
"This perfume by Shakira has a pleasant scent. I can detect sweet and spicy notes in it. It is not very strong, which is good. It definitely fades over the course of the day, but I can still detect light whiffs at the end of the day. The bottle is attractive, but the cap or lid is way too plain. You have the sexy body shaped bottle and then there's a little clear plastic lid that has not aesthetics at all. If you could be the lid to anything and doesn't stand out at all.",1

"There are 12  supremely soft non-shedding make-up brushes in this set with a silicone brush head cleanerbrush that doubles as a mini-brush holder. This is a gorgeous set that contains a brush for most uses. There is no fan, eyebrow, or lip brush, however.<br /><br />This is an attractive brush set in matte black. Unfortunately, the color of the silicone cleaner cannot be chosen. I thought I was going to get purple to match with my purple bathroom and I received a pink one.  <br /><br />The bristles are velvety soft and they do not fall out, which is great. Their soft bristles feel fantastic against my skin and work like many other brushes I tried previously. I particularly LOVE the large blush/foundation brush. The only thing to note is that because the bristles are super soft, these brushes are more suited for powder applications than cream or liquid.<br /><br />The current price of $19.99 is reasonable for this quality set as it comes to $1.67 per brush or $1.54 per item if counting the silicone cleaner.",1
"This night cream has a good, thick consistency. It's definitely a cream and not like a balm. It has a strong scent to it. It smells like a flowery perfume. It smells nice, but it is strong. If you are sensitive to smells, this may not be for you. I don't have any problems with it, though I do prefer citrus scents over flowers, but that's just a personal preference. It doesn't leave my skin feeling sticky or greasy. It absorbs pretty well.",1

"Surprisingly, I really like this mask. I already tried their [[ASIN:B07VQY9ZP2 WeeklyPoint Cosmetic Saffron mask sheet]] and found it to be very messy and just okay. This one is less messy.<br /><br />There are ten individually wrapped masks in this package. The instructions are in broken English but still easy to understand. I applied this mask to my clean face -- there are holes for eyes, nose, and mouth. It was somewhat wet but not dripping wet as their other mask. I prefer less solution, so this was perfect. I let it stay on for exactly 20 minutes and then removed the mask and wiped off the excess. My face felt moisturized and silky. I reveled in the soft rose fragrance the entire time.  However, the claims that it brightens the skin and protects them from wrinkles is unfounded in my opinion. On the other hand, the rose fragrance is calming and wonderful and the moisturizing effect is silky and these are my two favorite traits of this moisturizing sheet.<br /><br /> ",1
Terrible quality. Did not even last 18hours.,1

"My daughter received a UV Light Manicure Light last year for Christmas from her aunt. It came with a couple of colors, but she is thrilled to have this nice variety of colors now. The quality of the nail polish is comparable to other gel nail polishes that we have bought. It works as it should. She has polished her nails once so far with this set. As of now, it's been one week and they all look as good as the first day. Usually gel polish lasts for about 2 weeks on her, so at this rate, she thinks the results will be the same. One thing she didn't like was that the bottles are not labeled or marked to indicate what colors they are. To solve this, we put a drop of nail polish on the back of each bottle. The polish wouldn't dry without the LED light, which we realized after 5 hours of waiting. So we took a piece of clear tape and covered the polish drop. So now she can easily identify the right bottle without having to open each one.",1
