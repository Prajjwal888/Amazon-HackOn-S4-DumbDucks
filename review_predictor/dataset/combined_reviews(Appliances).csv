Easy to install. Use for a GE refrigerator.,1
Works just as good as the original.,1
The product's installation process was straightforward and efficient.,0
"The product review's tone is overly positive, using phrases like 'original review', 'look at the photos carefully','made to fit various styles', and 'waaaay bigger in diameter' to describe the product's size and features.",0
The item arrived promptly and performed flawlessly.,0
"These egg protectors are a great addition to my kitchen, ensuring that my eggs remain safe and sound.",0
"I must admit, my husband and I weren't convinced this would work so great.  We were quickly proven wrong; this works and it works well. It is SO easy to use. Requires 2 AAA batteries (not included) which are simple to install in the base. The instructions say to put frozen beer in the dispenser-we didn't freeze ours, we used VERY cold beer. Place the dispenser in the base, press down (not with force) and within seconds...FOAM!  Its pretty neat. The beer looks and tastes like its just been tapped. Without a doubt, this is worthy of gift giving. The price is reasonable.<br /><br />Recommended!",1
"I thought we needed a new oven, but turned out to be the control panel. My brother installed it in no time, and it works perfect, so far. The only complaint is that it doesn't come with the control panel faceplate, so if you can't peel the old one off, you'll have to buy a new one for a ridiculous. $40.",1
My dryer vent goes out the roof and wasnt drying clothes. This fixes the problem,1
Ordered wrong part but the quality of this part seemed very good.,1
"These black appliances blend in effortlessly with my black stove, making for a sleek and stylish kitchen.",0
GREAT,1
I'd like to share my experience with the product.,0

Great purchase as are most of the things I get from Amazon.,1

They work well and water taste good.,1
I was delighted to find the perfect product to shield my dual fuel range surface.,0
these work just fine.,1
I can't say enough positive things about this product.,0
"This mini fan does a good job of keeping you cool. It has three fan speeds along with misting functionality. You can add ice water to a small compartment to turn the fan into an evaporative cooler. When using this function, it's best to use distilled water. There's a flexible handle that can be used to hang the fan if wanted. You can use it as a night light or as color therapy with or without the fan. There's also a useful timer function. This is a good buy!<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1
The product performed efficiently and effectively.,0
"We appreciate your understanding, and we are glad to hear that the K475 is a durable and fast-shipping product.",0
These filters are a great choice for anyone looking to enhance their water quality.,0
These are made of silicon so they're heat resistant and flexible and cover the spaces between my stove and counter with no gaps. My old ones were hard plastic that warped and even melted around the edges when they got too hot.,1
We were delighted to find a replacement handle for our Frigidaire refrigerator that only required a few simple steps for installation.,0
Helps keep my kitchen clean,1
"Exceptional quality and great craftsmanship, an excellent choice for anyone looking for top-notch products.",0
"The filter replacement process is a breeze, requiring minimal time and effort, with minimal mess.",0
"This product is a top-notch choice for anyone looking for a 24"" wide unit.",0
The product offers excellent value for its cost.,0
I recently encountered a rather disappointing experience with the product in question.,0
"Before silicon counter gap covers came out I had thinner Medal ones I had to paint black, and they didn't clean well!<br />And Those made noise, and the paint would rub off, and I had to paint them a few more times.<br />These are silicon they stay in place, are easy to wipe the sponge over them and there clean.<br />These are wide enough that nothing falls down the sides<br /><br />This is not my first set of these gap  covers, this pair are for another home on my property , for a new stainless stove I'm putting in there for my son. These  silicon gap covers are long, and easy to cut to size with a kitchen sizzlers.<br /><br />These gap covers can be put in the dishwasher but there so easy to clean with a sponge no need for the dishwasher.<br />When I bought my other gap covers I truthfully bought  the the least expensive set there all the same.<br />Although if I put these in the dishwasher I would put them on the top rack.<br /><br />Btw the plastic sticks that come with this are to some how be used underneath if you have a wide gap.",1
Good recommend it,1
"Great for my pour- over coffee carafes. Just the right size. Keeps grounds out of our coffee, does not change the flavor and clean up is a snap.",1
"These make using your reusable kcup type cup holder a bit easier to clean and therefore maybe you'll want to use it more often.  :)  I will say that if your reusable shell cup is taller, you should purchase the taller liners.  These work best with the stubbier shells.",1
"LG water and air filters, as well as their three-door dual ice makers, are top-of-the-line products that provide excellent value for their price.",0
"My husband insists on using these all the time, they are great and so is the value.",1
"Installed very easily and worked perfectly, no complaints!",1
This washes clothes just as good as any washing machine. Only issues I have is it has the smallest drain hose and takes forever to drain. The spin cycle is a joke. Don't buy it for the spin cycle it doesn't help drying at all. Just a waste of time. I live in a dry area so this wasn't very important for me. The basket is small and worthless. I just removed the basket and the clothes still agitate just fine.  It is much better than having to make stops just to do laundry while in the RV.,1
"This refrigerator unit is an excellent choice for families, effectively storing ice and maintaining a cold temperature.",0
Excellent product that I highly recommend.,0
We were delighted to come across such superbly crafted pod coffee filters.,0
"While blow drying is not an exact science, this particular blow dryer proved to be an efficacious and reliable tool.",0
This product is an excellent addition to any home.,0
"I live out here in Arizona, I put this little refrigerator in my bathroom because I have a lot of products that I put on my face and serum's , creams body lotion and other things. It came dented but I would not send it back because it works just as expected!",1
"This does make new ice pretty fast and takes up very little counter space. The only reason for 4 out 5 stars is that the ice tends to melt kind of fast.  I've double checked to make sure everything is closed on the machine, and that it's not too close to the wall or anything else.",1
üëçüëç,1
"The product initially performed superbly, but after a few months, it started to deteriorate internally.",0
"My electrician told me that 100 cfm was good for 70 square feet.  So, my bathroom is on the borderline just a little too big but I got it anyway and am happy with it.  It takes a regular sized bulb which is good and we put an LED bulb.  We may switch back to a regular bulb.  We did not hook up the night light so can't tell you about that.  Hooked it up to regular 4&#34; exhaust line.",1
These were easy to install and seem sturdier that the original. Price was great!,1
"Beautiful but very thin & warped. The warping COULD possibly be that they were wrapped & taped so tightly but I was unable to get them to lay flat. Even on a completely flat surface, they were still teetering. They only serve their purpose if you weigh them down....which defeats the purpose. So, my wife made a tier tray out of them. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",1
The company responded very quickly. Refunded purchase price right away. No problems at all. The unit did not work. I tried ev,1
I found this product review quite informative and detailed.,0
Amazing product and exceptional value.,0

Nice  3 drawer freezer.  Holds a lot.,1
"This product is an excellent choice for parents with infants as it can be used for storing and transporting baby formula, juice, or other liquids.",0
"wow, is this a rip off or what? after I cleaned out the dogs water bowl, this black residue was left from the filter. and several glasses of ice water were the same, black grainy residue.",1
Good price and seems to do the job except it leaves behind a slightly metallic taste to the water. 1 filter lasts us about 3-4 months for moderate usage in a 2-person household. That seems really fast to me when other brands have lasted 6 months or more.,1
"I am immensely pleased with my purchase, as it arrived promptly and perfectly tailored to my needs.",0
Perfect,1
Great money saving idea which brews great coffee. Disapointed that there are many much cheaper copies of the same thing on the market since we purchased this one.,1
We tested the product and found it to be of high quality.,0
We have had this product for a while and the water taste is great. I think it is good to rinse all filters before the first use to get best results.,1

I was pleasantly surprised by the exceptional quality and unbeatable price of this product.,0

The handles are uneven so I'm not able to use them.,1
This handy product performs exceptionally well and exceeded my expectations.,0
Very nice pod coffee filters. They seem to be very well made and sturdy. We are pleased with them.,1
I love how easy this filter replacement is! It takes only a few moments with almost no clean up!! Very happy with the purchase!,1
This handy kitchen gadget provides the perfect solution for any messy cook.,0
I've had a like product but the one thing I didn't like was that grinds never emptied completely. These cups empty all the way and with just a couple taps with the finger. They are very easy to use and clean.,1

"Over the years I have developed my own morning time routine and coffee is a part of it. I have GERD so my GI specialist wants me to limit caffeine. I try to keep it at 1 cup every morning. This half-caff allows me to have a second cup! It tastes good, although I do had my flavored sugar free creamer to it, so I'm not drinking it black. The k-cups work well in my Keurig. This box has 100 k-cups, so that should last me a while.",1

"I actually purchased this to pour one cup of water into my individual cup coffee maker.  So I don't froth milk.. but this pitcher is good for my larger mugs - the other one is smaller mugs - I actually purchased the smaller one first, by accident...Using this pitcher is just easier than guessing how much to pour in.  Overflowing your brewed coffee is such a mess.  They wash in the dishwasher easily - just like your stainless steel utensils.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.",1
"The Laundry Alternative machine is a cute product and I love the mint green color! It is performing well for me as it does laundry.  Takes small amount of detergent, (or softener); operates by turning a level to spin tub around on its stand.  Instructions provided which suggest minutes to spin, alternating front & back spins, based on load size.<br /><br />If your wash load is only lightly dirty you can remove that load and put aside for rinsing and place another load in your Laundry Alternative and proceed with washing process in the same detergent.  This will save on your water bill and detergent as well.<br /><br />Following the washing cycle I use a spin machine that removes excess water; therefore, eliminating having to use hands to squeeze water out of each piece.<br /><br />Time it takes clothes to dry after hanging up is surprisingly short, especially on a sunny day.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy your new Laundry Alternative as much as I do! IMO the<br />whole process of using the Laundry Alternative isn't lengthy and it saves money.",1
"With 2 containers you can store 28 eggs.  These wash easily, but not in the dishwasher.  The bottom is ok, but the top warped.",1
"It is indeed a fine machine, and when functioning properly, it offers a delightful experience.",0
If you love pellet ice then this is the unit for you.  I put this in my bar and use it almost every day.  It does put out some heat and is a little loud when it is making ice but I absolutely love it!,1
We use ours daily and they work great.  We rinse them and place them in the basket area of our dishwasher and they hold up perfectly.,1

The product received a positive review with a conclusion indicating the reviewer would only use OEM replacements in the future.,0
The Honeywell humidifier is the best I've ever had. Easy to clean and needs cleaning only once a month. The filter lasts about 6 weeks so it's great to be able to buy it in a value pack.,1
This product was a breeze to set up.,0

I would highly recommend this propane stove to anyone looking to cook delicious meals while camping.,0

I am pleased to share my experience with this product.,0
I was thrilled to have the opportunity to review this product.,0
Installing this product was a breeze.,0
This was hard to find out how to put it into the office maker. I think better instructions would have been nice. I ended up poking a hold in the bottom when I put the lid down. Now coffee grounds come out into my coffee. I would not buy this product again.,1
The price was good and the product fit my LG fridge perfectly.,1
Absolutely perfect product. Just what was ordered and wanted.,1
Have been buying these from Amazon for a long time. Different brands but all good prices.,1
Do not forget to get all the parts you need to complete the job. Part was right price and shipped on time.,1
great size very easy to use,1
strong quality burner covers.  I washed it and spots developed.  I contacted the seller who said that spots were unusual and they sent me a replacement set.  thank you for making a quality prodcut,1
"I love having a refrigerator just for beer! We have half size refrigerator for drinks, but that gets full pretty quickly with water bottles, sodas, and juice. Now we can put the beer and malt beverages in this refrigerator and keep the rest of the drinks in the old one. The glass shelves are very sturdy and easy to rearrange. The older half size refrigerator has plastic shelves and when you put a lot of weight on the shelves, it has shown signs of cracking and bowing. Not the case with this refrig. I have filled it with a mix of beer and sparkling tall/slim cans. I might be able to get a couple more cans in there, but I think it's pretty close to capacity. It's easy to adjust the temperature with the digital display. It's doing a great job of keeping our adult beverages nice and cold.",1
I will buy these again for sure,1
These products are of the finest quality and are built to last.,0
"Work just as well as the more expensive name brand filters, but at a fraction of the cost.",1
but i havent had it long  a year down the road  i may change my mind and i love the blue trim  i  didnt realize it matches my  shower curtain so well as its not solid  but pretty swirls of  purples and blues and this matches it nicely  i got the first one and it was broken so i did a return and replace but  im impressed and its quiet and i like tht it has no agitator  for things to get stuck under !!,1

"I have a multi-use coffeemaker that makes a ton of coffee and tea drinks. It has a frother attachment. I'll heat up the milk  in the microwave in a glass and pour it in the pitcher and froth it.<br /><br />TIP: As a former barista, I know how to make the perfect froth. When using the frother attachment, I move the pitcher up and down until the milk is almost at the top, then carefully pound it on the kitchen counter a few times. As I add honey to my coffee, the frothed milk gets a dense foam. I'll add the froth to the cup, then pour the milk in. You can make the perfect latte or cappuccino by using this method that is even better than any you'll get at a cafe.",1
Great replacement,1
"These MaxRona reusable K cups are exactly what we needed for our Keurig brewer. They're simple to use, fit perfectly in the machine and allow us to brew whatever coffee/tea we want-we're not tied down to buying K cup pods only for our machine.  They do not, in any way, change the flavor of the beverage being brewed in the brewer.  Every cup we brew is delicious and perfect.  While the reusable K cups are dishwasher safe, our is broken so I hand wash them after each use. They clean well with no issues.  I love the flexibility of being able to brew anything we want that comes with these reusable K cups.  They're wonderful but if you're not satisfied, MaxRona offers a 100% money back or replacement guarantee!",1
These are great! Highly recommended!,1

These are a great way to save a little money with those K cups.  K cups are very expensive and I need to save where I can.,1

"The ice maker in the office has been broken for a couple of years, and when there was ice it was gathered up by one or two individuals so there wasn't any available anyway. I selected this ice maker for use in my office for my own use (with my office mates). This ice maker proved itself on the very first day it was used.<br /><br />This ice maker is about the size of a coffee maker - a little shorter, a little wider. It doesn't require a lot of space on the counter and finding a place to put it should be easy in all but the tightest of spaces.<br /><br />Operation is simple. Pour in the water and power it on, and the ice maker does the rest. It stops when it runs out of water and it stops when it runs out of room for ice cubes. Ice gets dumped in a little basket in the top so it's all contained and easy to get out.<br /><br />We turned it on, and we were all floored by how quiet this thing runs. It is quieter than a refrigerator when it is running. It does make a little noise when it dumps the ice cubes, but it isn't loud at all when it does that - again quieter than the ice maker in a refrigerator.<br /><br />There are two size settings - large and small. So far, we have only used the large setting.<br /><br />One thing we have observed about it is that the first couple of ice cube dumps produce smaller, thinner ice cubes. Once the ice maker has been running for 20-30 minutes the ice gets thicker.<br /><br />The ice comes out wet, as to be expected, very much like ice cream comes out of an ice cream maker very soft. This isn't a problem and is normal but if you have not worked with an ice maker like this in the past it can come as a surprise.<br /><br />And... This ice maker is fast! We had ice within 10 minutes of plugging it in and turning it on. It produces cubes a little faster than once every 10 minutes, and in about an hour the tray is getting close to full. I have not tried filling the reservoir and seeing how long it takes to run out of water.<br /><br />So far, all of us are very pleased with this ice maker. It works quietly and quickly, it's not too big, and it's easy to keep in an office where ice is otherwise hard to come by.",1
"The filter did not fit in my Keurig K50. When closing the keurig, there was still a small gap that left the keurig slightly open. I had to hold down the keurig in order to get it to register that it was shut and allow me to select my cup size, and still had to hold it down while it was brewing. Then, the water barely flowed through the filter. Tried with a finer grind as described on the instructions. After a minute of holding it there, I had only less than half a cup of coffee. I tried again with a medium grind and still had the same issue. Decided it was not worth my hassle and to return it. Return was easy and was provided with a free return label.",1
I'm very happy with my new measuring cup. üòç<br />I had been using a Pyrex 1 cup measuring glass cup and the milk froth is so so so much faster with the new cup. I've been using everyday for a week now and again very happy with this item.<br />Amazing how fast the milk froths in this cup.,1
I can certainly vouch for the exceptional value in this product.,0
"We have an older house, built in 1900. No one ever drilled holes to the outside for a dryer vent. This item is perfect and very sturdy. Just wish it was a little cheaper.",1
"PERFECTLY WORKED
Final Verdict: Highly recommend!
In today's review, we're taking a look at [Product Name].It performed excellently, exceeded our expectations, and we couldn't be happier with the outcome.",0
I pour this in after I have added the water.  This keeps it from getting foamy.  I use it in a Kenmore whole house humidifier and it works just fine.,1
Good Product,1
I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this product.,0
We recently purchased a new dryer and are delighted with its performance.,0
No noticeable difference between LG branded filter and this one!,1

"I recently purchased this oven control panel, and I'm glad to report that it has been a valuable addition to my kitchen.",0
exceptional quality and seamless installation...$160 well spent.,0
I watched and internet video on replacing this myself and this worked perfectly for the part. Saved me a lot on big money not having to have a professional come out just for a broken element! I recommend.,1
"The Laundry Alternative machine is a delightful product, boasting a charming mint green color.",0
I am quite impressed with this coffee maker.,0
"My filters arrived very quickly (2 days). However, even though the box states the same filter # compatible with my Samsung #DA29-00020B, they do not fit. This filter would not go all the way in, therefore I could not lock it in place. When I compared it with the filter I removed I could see the top of this filter where the opening is, is way different. I will be returning these.",1
I was paying $49.00 per filter at another store for the Samsung brand. I can buy 4 for that price here.<br />Each filter lasts 6 months. My hubby drinks a lot of water from the frig system.,1
Nothing compares to name brand Chemex...excellent,1
Anyone with a Bunn coffee maker know you need real Bunn filter because they are taller. These are cheaper and just as good.,1
This Whirlpool dryer offers excellent performance and reliability.,0
The last time I bought a filter for my refrigerator water it was three times this price! Now I have three for the price of one. Fit perfectly easy to install so far so good two weeks in,1
"The water's quality is excellent, with no musty taste detected.",0
"It's ok. Mine doesn't stay closed and it's difficult to clean. Even when I use a baby spoon to scrape it clean, I find I have to rinse out the grounds, which will eventually create a build-up problem in the kitchen drain. Might try the paper filter insets, but  besides an additional cost, they will probably make it even more difficult to keep this closed.  Love the idea of this, just needs a bit of a design tweak.",1
Highly functional and well-packaged product.,0

"If you have reusable single cup maker and cup these liners are a must have for easy clean up.  Much easier on the landfill than the plastic cups.  Easy to use and the 'lid' on the top is actually a game changer.  Keeps the grounds exactly where they are suppose to be - in the making cup - NOT your drinking cup.  Love them, feel really comfortable recommending them.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.",1
I am not sure what type of Keurig I have but this works great in it!  It sits up high enough so it does not get punctured like a regular k-cup does.  I would recommend this product.  Works great and easy to clean.  Like that the bottom is screen like the sides.,1
The percolator is a fantastic coffee-making appliance that significantly simplifies the cleanup process.,0
"I buy this brand because the quality is good, they last for 6 months like Samsung filters and they are about half the price. I recommend this filter",1
This coffee maker is designed to provide a consistent and convenient way to brew your favorite coffee.,0
"This product offers great value for its price, making it an excellent investment.",0
"Works great,  but get a air freshener for the area it's to be used.  For the first day or two it made the whole house stink while running.  Shut it off a couple days and turned back on still a oil odor but not as bad with a battery powered air freshener.  Makes ice and works good though at least.",1
Works with my Keurig.,1
"The product's ice-making capabilities seem to be subpar, as it fails to maintain the desired coldness.",0
Very nice. Flat and slim fits down top lint compartment well and gets the stuff out!,1
"Everything about this product worked perfectly, from its intuitive design to its efficient performance.",0
Just get it!,1
Finding a Keurig that is aesthetically pleasing is a rare occurrence.,0
These affordable filters deliver top-notch performance that rival more expensive name brand filters.,0
Just what I needed.  So glad they are still available.  And at a reasonable price.  Prompt delivery too.,1

"Thanks to the innovative design, these replacement Keurig filters are a perfect fit.",0
Could not install,1
"so many uses these maison jars. I love the versatility as you could make preserves or pickles.  That aside, the humidity jar is useful for my special grains, which keeps them from moulding until I can 'mill' them for baking.  when I dont have grains, I could use this for my sourdough starter - large enough when I am baking a lot.  I love it is made of glass - sustainable and easy to clean in dishwasher.",1
I am thrilled to have come across a splendidly functional filter that delivers superbly at an incredibly reasonable price.,0
"The freezer performs flawlessly, even in a limited space.",0
These miniature filters are a great addition to any household.,0
I couldn't be more pleased with the efficiency of this filter.,0
"We got this as a reusable  container for our home raised eggs and for the most part it is perfect, except for our Orpington who apparently can produce eggs that are too big for the hole that the eggs fit in.  For the others it is very nice, cradling each egg on a little springy platform and held by the single sized walls.  Truly it would be better if all eggs were covered in this solution, but it does hold a lot of smaller and medium eggs.<br /><br />I'm not sure if we will start to religiously use the date slider.  We did mark our first eggs with it, but we tend to cycle through the eggs pretty quickly either through cooking or gifting so date stamping may not be needed.  It should clean reasonably well and we did run it through the dishwasher before initial use.  Love how it stacks in the fridge.  All in all we are pretty happy.",1
I am glad to hear that the issue with the dryer vent has been resolved.,0
Great have purchased before -,1
"These are perfect--not pliable, and wide enough. My stove isn't level with my counter so, I really needed this.",1
Worked ok.  Takes a little practice and easily makes a mess if you don't carefully use per directions.  If you are coordinated you'll be fine.  Turns out my machine wouldn't take the &#34;manual&#34; cup - so I gave the cup and this piece with it away.,1
Perfect for my Christmas Ornaments.  Very good quality and very large.,1
I can definitely vouch for the performance of these versatile kitchenware.,0
The Kalita Wave Pour over Coffee system is a superb choice for coffee aficionados.,0
"This is great for a stove that has raised burners.  It gives extra counter space when only using two burners on the stove.  Great for small kitchen spaces.  Love the bamboo.  It's lightweight, durable and easy to clean.",1
"we are using it, it seems fine. however, a stainless steel might last longer, as the plastic coating usually disintegrates because of the heating element",1
"I thought I'd give these a try since I found my regular K-Cups lacking in creating a quality cup of coffee.<br /><br />I have my own beans I grind for my drip or french press, so thought this might help.<br />It works .. but for me, these make too weak a cup of coffee (highly watered down)<br />I've tried filling with max coffee, but to no avail.<br />The EZ-Cup and Filter just does not hold enough coffee to do the job.<br /><br />Maybe a stronger coffee will help, but I can't use my favorite beans with method, so why bother.<br /><br />I'm going back to the regular K-Cups for a speedy single-cup of java (although lacking in quality)<br />and will use my drip/press when I want a full pot of quality.<br />Preparing the EZ-Cups for use takes almost as long as just making a pot of coffee (so again why bother)<br /><br />Still looking for something to create a quality k cup of coffee that rivals my drip/press.<br /><br />The search goes on ..",1
The Kalita Wave Pour over Coffee system is really great.  It makes an outstanding one cup and delivers robust flavor!,1

these are OK  a little tooo big  but they work  i had ordered Melita discs and they were so flimsy  !!,1

"I wasn't sure whether these were worth it or not, given the cost compared to the original branded filters.<br /><br />I can happily report that these are a great value and work every bit as good as the original. If you are on the fence worrying whether these are worth it- I can assure you they are.",1
"There are 40 #4 cone coffee filters in this package for the current price of $7. This is more than 4 times the price of what I can get at my local store. I can get 100 of these type filters for $3.42. ¬†Nevertheless, these work as designed and are a perfect coffee filter option.<br /><br />I attached before and after photos. Note that I didn't realize my unit is more basket type so I should not have used a cone filter; this is why you see the filter below the rim. However, if I had a cone basket it would be at the rim.<br /><br />I like these filters but they are pricey. The price is the ONLY reason I rated them 4 stars.",1
Our refrigerator didn't come with an ice maker and trays are a pain and take up too much space. My uncle gifted me his old one to see if I could repair it but it was not meant to be. So I ordered this one. It's just about perfect for our little family.. it has no problem at all keeping up with our usage. If I could change anything it would have been a larger container for the ice but it really doesn't need that unless we have some kind of big gathering and that's incredibly unlikely lol.<br /><br />It's perfect for our family - three adults and the occasional pieces of ice in the dogs and cats water bowls.,1
Effortlessly efficient and a pleasure to use.,0
Exceptional product that exceeded my expectations.,0
"I checked with customer service before purchasing to make sure this stove would work off grid in my camper.  They said yes.  Wrong! This must have  120v connected to work.  So, this won't work off grid OR in a Power outage.<br />Ruined a 400 dollar countertop in my camper installing a propane stove that won't work off grid.",1
outstanding product for keeping humidity levels in check; highly recommend.,0
I am unable to find any significant flaws with the product.,0
"Absolutely stunning and top-of-the-line!
Final Verdict: Highly recommended for all looking for the very best.",0
Good item,1
Little on the thin side,1
"I was so excited to use this for cold brew since I love so many OXO products, but this was a disappointment. I've been making cold brew in a French press until now, and I have been pleased with the results, but since it requires hands on filtering, I thought this OXO system would simplify the filtering and allow the machine to do most of the work. Wrong.<br />With a French Press, once the coffee has brewed, I can press the coffee and separate most of the grounds from the cold brew. Then I slowly pour it out into a mesh filter lined with a paper filter and wait for it to slowly seep through. I have to change the paper filter half way through before pouring the second half.<br />With this OXO system, you are supposed to be able to flip the switch and the cold brew will drip down in to the glass carafe below. But the grounds kept clogging the filter and then absolutely no liquid could get through. (I will also note that I have a quality conical burr grinder, so the grind should not be an issue.) I had to stand over it for about 15 min scraping the grounds to the side or scooping spoonfuls of grounds out of the brewing container. After 15 minutes of this, we were left with roughly 2/3 of the volume of cold brew we would have gotten from the same recipe in a French press. The reduced volume was partially due to me scooping grounds out of the way and throwing them in the sink, and partially because there was no way to effectively press the liquid out of the grounds. Also the taste was inferior. Again probably because the most concentrated cold brew couldn't be pressed out of the grounds.<br />Overall the taste was nowhere as good and the process was more cumbersome than a French press. I wish I loved this machine, but on the plus side, it's one less thing to sit on my counter and take up more space in the fridge.",1
Fast delivery and exactly what we needed,1
I'm thrilled to inform you that my ice maker is top-of-the-line and provides unparalleled performance.,0
The SmartWasher Benchtop pro cleaning system is an excellent addition to any cleaning arsenal.,0
Does not fit snuggly into the gap. Very lite weight and flimsy. Does not stay in place. Comes out with the slightest bump. I dont feel this is safe to have so close to stove burners. Threw them out.,1
"I recently purchased the Whirlpool Cabrio Washer and Dryer, and I must say, the noise level is indeed quite loud.",0
Very nice machine when it works right,1
"I think most people who buy this have babies and use it for bottles/etc.  I do a lot of juicing and put them in jars/etc, I also recycle other containers, put caps in here, many things!!! i love it.",1
really handy works great,1
Great that Amazon carries these not easy to find filters.  Close enough to the originals.,1

Meticulously crafted and superbly efficient.,0
"Great part, and saved hundreds for a handy man.",1
This is my second refrigerater with a waterfilter on the bottom and I love it. The water tastes teriffic and you do not need to buy water in the store. I recomment Wirlpool refrigerator hightly with this water filter. This replacement filter is also less money on Amazon.,1
WORKED WELL,1
Didnt fit my shelf. LLP,1
Great switch. Pops in where the old one pooped out. Quality and part looks OEM.,1
These filters are an excellent choice for those looking to maximize their budget without sacrificing quality.,0
Works like a charm!,1
"Same  blower wheel that you pay a lot more for elsewhere.  Great product at a great price.  But these whirlpool dryers usually have more than this wrong with it so be prepared to need more stuff, at least this helps with the cost of fixing these dryers with reasonable prices.",1
Did not fit my microwave,1
GREAT,1
"Very easy to use! Made sealing cookies a breeze! Just an FYI, I used treat bags from Hobby Lobby on the level two setting and followed the directions on the side of the sealer.",1
The product was delivered promptly and was of a reasonable price.,0
"I ordered these after looking into replacements for my coffee maker.  Most are outrageously expensive, so when I found these I was thrilled.  For about the price of a pack of 2 of the brand name filters, I got 12.  I am sure they will work perfectly for my use.  I will update if there are any issues.  They arrived quickly (I have prime) and in very good condition.  I will also note that they are all individually wrapped.  Another bonus.  If you need these kidney shaped water filters for your coffee maker, I would recommend trying these for the price alone.",1
The product met or exceeded my expectations and arrived in a timely fashion.,0
"These fit the stove well, look good, do the job, but they have nothing holding them in place and are too easily moved out of position.  They need some double sided tape or something to hold them in place.",1
Excellent coffee maker.,0
These filters are nice and tall and prevent Coffee grounds from overflowing Into the pot.,1
Fast shipping and definitely a brand new OEM part.,1
Worked well. Fit perfectly. Arrived when promised.,1
"I so love my Electrolux fridge that it would only figure you would have to stand upside down to insert the air filters, not so. Easy as anything and I am happy.",1

"I'm not going to leave one star because of my error. the product does seem durable, it was a great deal and shipped fast. I have the K475 which isn't stated in the description, however I thought it may work regardless. It didn't.<br />I'm leaving my review for others with the same machine to know this model won't work.",1
They work well.,1
"These feet fit my 1998 KitchenAid stovetop. They are a bit thicker than the original pads, so I just replaced all of them. The additional height has no impact on how the grates function.",1
Excellent unit. Replaced a hard to Find 24&#34; wide unit. Highly recommend this stove top to anyone interested in 24&#34; wide unit. AAA++++,1
"I am thrilled to share that my refrigerator fit perfectly with the product, and it arrived on time as promised.",0
"I ordered these filters on the recommendation of another Amazon reviewer when I bought a single serve coffeemaker that allows you to use your own coffee without a special cup.  I like the filters, and I find that they eliminate most of the stray coffee grounds.  I find that some coffee grounds do escape the filter, though there is a secondary filter that catches them.  In the meantime, these little filters make it easier to clean the primary filter.  Therefore, I do recommend them and will buy more when I run out of these.",1
i have a K15 and was concerned it wouldnt fit  but it was PERFECT !!!,1
"Excellent quality, highly recommended.",0
Works perfect,1
these products are highly efficient and excellent for their purpose.,0

Good Product,1
These works perfectly in my refrigerator.  Easy to install.,1
"The product's features are outstanding, as the user can effortlessly seal the capsules with the provided cap, enhancing their experience.",0
It lets the coffee flow out the top of it and into your cup!..Also the holes are TOO big in the filter basket allowing the coffee grounds to flow through it!....DO NOT BUY THIS FILTER!,1
"This is a good looking coffee drip system, and does work well.<br />My husband travels and said this type is a hassle , compare to the regular type.<br />It needs to be washed with a kitchen brush after using it But more important is you still need to use<br />A paper cone coffee filter as all coffee has a oil that causes a cholesterol problem if you don't use<br />A paper filter to absorb it.<br /><br />The Oil is call Cofestol, and Kohweol. Many people that eat low cholesterol , but drink allot of coffee can't understand why they have a high cholesterol , this could be the reason!<br /><br />If your looking for a good coffee dripper this does work good. Although the wire cage that holds this can<br />Be knocked over easy, and it's just another gimmick I think.<br /><br />This is my honest opinion.",1
"its really too big to fit model #34357.  Must squeeze it into holder and then too difficult to snap shut.  The original filters worked so much better.  I tried the new paper one and thought nope..too flimsy.  So I ordered these.  A shame as humidifier has been terrific for some years now. But it filters can't be found, I'll have to buy a new one and order a few dozen filters for it at time of purchase.",1
I highly recommend these filters as they provide top-notch performance and outstanding value.,0
Makesure you watch a video on how to install for tricks to make it easy to install. It foxed our problem of ice forming in the deep freezer.,1
We are pleased to hear that our replacement Keurig filters have been a satisfactory addition to your coffee-making experience.,0
"These are great, especially when cooking items that overflow the pot , like soup. When a spill occurs, you simply put the burner in the sink to soak. Minimal mess left on stove. After it soaks and you wash off the grime, simply place it back on stove burner. The items are thin, so do not clean completely and evertualy need to be thrown out due to wear. But they make cleaning the stove much easier and are just pennies  each.",1
As advertised,1
"01/23 update: trying a different brand of lids when I ran out‚Ä¶ I came back SO FAST!! Others failed me miserably!!! TBH, I was surprised to see any had issue using these- as these have single-handedly saved my coffee budget. If you take a minute to do the steps- truly, it can work like a charm!<br /><br />Finally- A fix to the costly pod price for Nespresso coffee maker! Not only does the have to use pod cost a pretty penny.. but, they limit the ability to try different options in your coffee maker.. and limit any ability to go green. That's a lot of control for one tiny appliance to have!! (IMHO!)<br /><br />Most important thing to know- SAVE YOUR OLD NEPRESSO PODS.. you NEED these in order to use these lids!! Every pod is marked with a barcode -hence the reason no other pod will work! This item is just the sealable aluminum foil top that lets you cover over up a refilled Nespresso pod. So, you must hold onto used pods in order to use this option. TBH, this was something I didnt realize when ordering..!!<br /><br />After cleaning, rinsing and drying your used pods 100%- you refill with the coffee of choice. **OK, this is where the foil lids come in! Carefully place the sealable purchased lid atop of pod.. BE SURE NOT TO OBSCURE THE BAR CODE FOUND ON SIDE..!! Foil is a tad bigger in diameter then pod cup itself- so it gives a bit of forgiveness when putting it on! DONT BE INTIMIDATED- I actually found prepping a handful at one time helps to find a rhythm and make things less of hassle vs. filling x1 every morning!! Coffee grounds stay fresh inside the sealed pod. Once shut these will store in whatever method you usually use- box, basket, display rack etc. all with the same fit.. the cute outer prints are a fun aesthetic! But, these designs are actually a way to differentiate between what you chose to fill the pod with. For example if using cappuccino = sunburst, decaf = stripes, etc. you have total of 4 designs.<br /><br />Hack: setting a roll of T.P. tipped tube side up- is a solid way to balance pod while adhering the new lid.. I know, sounds crazy but it steadies it for you!! See photo to show what I mean-<br /><br />Sorry so long winded- wanted to help others avoid any confusion. A great option for variety while  saving both money and planet! Hoping info can help your decision.. stay safe everyone.",1

"I don't even understand this icemaker. It does not keep the ice cold at all. So you make ice, and then the ice melts. It just doesn't work well. And it takes far too long to make ice for it to be useful. I tried leaving it out for a party, thinking that everyone have fresh ice, with the ice is always either half melted or people are sitting around waiting on the thing to finish making ended up absolutely hating it. Plus it takes up so much room. And it's so difficult to store, because you can't tip it in anyway because of the refrigerant in it.",1

"Look at the product photos carefully before purchasing. These are NOT CUSTOM FIT in the way you might reasonably assume. You have the option of choosing from dozens of different stove models which gives the impression your set will be cut to fit the specific-sized burners on your specific model stove while protecting other areas of the stove top - not so!<br /><br />Instead, these ""protectors"" are apparently made to fit various STYLES of stoves. For example, our style  stove has two burners on each side and a griddle in the center, so we were sent two side panels, each with two holes, and a center panel with one hole. That is where the ""custom"" aspect of this product ends, because the sizes of the holes are waaaay bigger in diameter than the burners, leaving large areas of our stove top (ironically, areas highly likely to receive spills) unprotected. Additionally, some areas of the protectors' borders are so narrow that any spilled food might as easily land on the stove top as on the protectors.<br /><br />The fact that the seller does not pay for return shipping makes me to believe they do not back up their product (our local post office told us that although the package is super light--which would normally qualify for 1st class shipping--this item's oversized packaging requires it be returned via Priority shipping, costing nearly $11).<br /><br />Bottom line: this would be a great product if were made by company with the desire to do the job right.",1
Couldn't get it to work. water valve opened and flooded my freezer and floor. Hired an appliance repair expert.  Determined that the unit was assembled wrong. Fingers and timer in wrong position. ordered an OEM part and it started working right away. Spent days trying to figure the Supco out. Bad quality control.They could not possibly have tested this before sending it out.,1

In conclusion, the product offers excellent performance and is a must-have for anyone looking for the best in the industry.",0

"Not worth the price.  Takes up too much space, putting water in for the wash cycle is difficult AND requires a space to drain the ""wash water"" into unless willing to hook it up to your kitchen sink, which is NOT Worth the effort.  Haul out a bucket of dirty dish water (kills weeds?)",1
The product in question serves its purpose admirably within the bathroom setting.,0
I love these filters they are a little larger than a 12 cup but much better then to small no more grounds in my coffee.,1

Just as stated, it was an exact fit.",1

"purchased these to go in a single cup maker I just purchased that came with an unusual sized ground coffee filter insert.  The taller paper inserts are a narrower than the cup it's self but are just the right height, works good.  Easy to scoop out the used paper insert - just remember not to overfill.  The shorter paper inserts are a tiny bit wider but not tall enough for this particular reusable filter cup.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful, but in this case, I'm pretty sure there will be little else to say... one hopes!",1
"The concept for the stove top cover can be a good idea.<br />I have a stainless and black 5 burner  GE stove about 15 yrs old.<br /> This cover is too small, which means I had to make the cut outs holes bigger but it still does Not fit good, or lay flat!<br /><br />I thought from reading this that the stove cover was silicone like the side strips are<br />That I already had, and love those.  It's obvious when my builder build my home that<br />He made the space for my stove too wide, as I didn't want the build-ins.<br />The cover is almost like a thicker type of cardboard material that does bend, but does not lay flat like silicone, or clean as easy like the Silicone side strips that come with this set does, that I actually just bought another set about a week before his Order For a rental house  I have.<br /><br />I cook for my family everyday since Covid 2 yrs ago,  and usually take my 3 large heavy creates off and clean my stove top after dinner.  Since this doesn't fit well on my stove top It's more of a hassle using this, or I have to get use to it and the Benefits of it.<br />As I said , If it would have been the silicone like the strips are that I was expecting this would be, as they also stay in place better I would be using that.",1

"I have always been annoyed with the dripping of the refrigerator water dispenser. I am frequently having to clean the white mineral stains. This is a great idea! It doesn't quite fit my refrigerator, but it does cover the area where the drips usually land. The width is nearly perfect. It's just not as deep as the area. There are 4 pads which is more than I need. I think 2 would be enough so I could have one under the water hose and one in the laundry.",1

So in the end I wouldn't only be out the humidifier I wanted I'd be out the cost of the humidifier and the cost of sending it back so I wouldn't even get the money I spent originally back in full. I've never paid return fees before, especially not for a defective product. Amazon has gone increasingly down hill very fast this last year and I honestly am done with Amazon at this point which is quite disappointing considering I'm disabled and Amazon was my main source of products for myself, my family and pets.",1

"Let's just be honest, I hate changing the fridge water filters as it's been sometimes nearly impossible to turn them with our arthritic hands, not to mention laying down on ceramic tile floor to try. This brand has to be the easiest application I've ever used. My Kenmore Elite side by side, gulped it in like a pleasant dessert. I did not encounter any resistance like some of the others.  I'm grateful that I found these.  I like the flavor, the fit and now the fridge will help keep us hydrated üí¶",1

"This SmartWasher Benchtop pro cleaning system is probably one of the best tool cleaners I have seen, and used.<br />It is a genius idea to use micro organisms to eat away all the oil thats mixed in with the cleaning solution.<br />Knowing that they have use the same system for oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico, makes me feel allot better about eco-friendly parts parts of the system.<br />I'm curious to see how long it takes for it to eat away and keep the solution clean, so far the solution that's coming out is still clean<br />Looking and there's not an odor residue either, and I've definitely used it on allot of oily small pieces,and gears for motors.<br /><br />Hope this helps<br />I recommend this SmartWasher.",1

Installation was very simple. Works great.,1
"These are super easy to set up. I like that once you have whatever you put on it you can lower the feet and it's basically there until you raise the feet again. On the other hand if you want something that you're going to be moving frequently like a portable washing machine, this is great for that too. Just don't lower the feet and you can move it wherever you want with the built in wheels. Highly recommend.",1

I like to run my humidifier at night (I use the HCM-710). I've been trying to remember to flip the filter either every day or every other day. I also have been using one of those little Protec fish things to try to keep it clean.  It's been working fine and I'll change the filter every month and the fish every two months so I can reorder them at the same time. If it starts to look pretty yellow then I give the humidifier a good scrubbing--I think it's probably from sediment in the tap water where I live. I could use filtered water but that'd take forever to fill every day and I'm too lazy for that. I've never had a mold problem.,1

Dryer broke within a year.  I contacted Pandas service dept.  They wanted me to do my own trouble shooting and remove the back panel and do my own repairs!  Then when I explained I'm disabled they charged me $50 and replaced it with a cheaper and smaller model.  DO NOT BUY PANDA.  Worst service ever.,1
I am thrilled to report that the product exceeded my expectations.,0
Could not be happier about purchasing this item it has all the setting and speed i need and it was very easy to install as well.,1
First machine lasted 6 months. Was replaced under warranty and that machine lasted about 7 months. The ice is great but who wants a $500 machine that doesn't even last 6 months. Highly disappointed!,1
"I was a little disappointed that it doesn't quite fit in my single cup maker - I had to really slam the top down - eventually I get it in.  Eh. It's like the puncture needle of my maker is a tiny bit off.  I do recommend the cup liners.  It brews a lighter than the commercial single coffee cups in my opinion - but if you have ground coffee - its worth a try just to keep the single use cups out of the garbage.  Just know it doesn't fit ALL single cup makers.  The maker I use is not a national brand.  All of that said, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.",1
"This VICKS HEALTHCHECK HUMIDITY AND TEMPERATURE MONITOR is a simple device that only does two things--display temperature (F. or C.) and relative humidity--but it does both really well.  The 3-1/2"" x 3"" monitor has a built-in stand, and a large, clear readout.  Beneath the display screen is a printed ""key"" that explains the ranges of relative humidity:  0% to 30% is too dry (dry eyes, nose & throat); 30% to 50% is the comfort zone (healthy breathing); and 50% to 85% is too humid for everyday (best for coughs & colds).<br /><br />Out of the box, the monitor took a few hours to display the correct room temperature, but it now agrees with the changing readings displayed by a couple of other devices in the same room.  More importantly, the relative humidity display is totally consistent with the automatic  humidity settings on my new whole-room humidifier.  I purchased this monitor because I didn't completely trust the humidifier's automatic sensor, which is probably too close to a furnace vent.  Now this monitor tells me when the humidifier should be turned on or off.",1

"Consumer Reports had high praise for several of the LG models, so after a string of 3 lemon washers in a row .. I decided to give LG a try.<br />Wow, this is really a nice washer. Quiet, well made, and an abundance of features (way more than I'll ever use)<br /><br />My last washer was a nightmare front loader that only made it 13 months .. and after reading a lot of issues with front loaders, I decided to go back to what just seems right .. a TOP LOADER.<br /><br />This LG unit is really nice, because un-like the older top-loaders, this unit has no pedestal. leaving way more room for things like a large comforter and clothes don't get tangled in it.<br /><br />This unit is also HE and can use the fancy new detergents.<br /><br />My only complaint thus far, is really minor and no biggie, on the cold cycles .. sometimes the pods don't break up completely.<br />So I just use liquid for cold cycles.<br /><br />Other than that .. really a great washer thus far (after 3 months of use)<br /><br />Even plays a nice little jingle when the wash is done. Thank You LG!<br /><br />*** UPDATE 10.9.2013 ***<br />Still running great (just like new)<br />No smells (leave the door open after washes to air out)<br />Handles comforters with ease (no pedestal in the center of tub)<br />no complaints thus far .. still LOVE IT",1

"My elderly father was recently in rehab for a few weeks. While he was there, both pairs of his pajama pants disappeared. He told the staff and a few days later he received 2 new pairs of pajama pants, but they weren't as soft and comfortable as his old, missing ones. Now he's back in his assisted living center and I plan to label all of his clothes. He hasn't had any problems at his place, but it's better to be prepared. These labels are pretty small. The whole package is pretty small and I almost missed it. It came in a box with other items so I didn't notice it at first. I tested it out on a couple of pieces of my own clothing. I used both a regular ball point pen on one and a fine tip Sharpie on the other. I was impressed that neither of them smeared, even after touching the ink right after writing on it. I affixed the stickers to the labels of the clothing items. After being laundered, they looked practically the same. These are great!! Perfect for kids at daycare, camp, and the elderly!",1

This filter will not work in most percolators. The problem is that the filter is a smaller diameter than the basket and it sticks up too high so that you cannot put the lid back on the basket. The basket lid would also make a lot of the water go outside of the filter instead of into it.,1

"This egg storage rack holds a lot of eggs. One rack holds 18 eggs. The spacing of the shelves in my refrigerator only fit one rack, so I am not using both of them right now. I have been putting the older eggs in the front and the newer ones in the back so we're using the older ones first. At first, the eggs weren't rolling forward when one was removed. We discovered that the rack was on the lip/edge of the shelf so we pushed it back a little and then the eggs were able to roll into position as ones were taken out.",1

I work in a bookstore and so these little gadgets are great for keeping an eye on humidity and temperature.

I am delighted to hear such positive feedback on our product.,0
"This washing machine is the noisiest!!!  And it's not just washing sounds that are loud.  It has different sounds depending on the setting.  This machine sounds like it's going to either explode or grind to a halt (with all the water in it) at any second.  Before the manufacturer's warranty expired we received a replacement machine, which was noisier than the one it replaced!  After the manufacturer's warranty, thank God we had the extended warranty, we had 3 repairmen come out until finally they gave us a credit to purchase another washer.  (Beware:  with extended warranties, you receive a depreciated payout - not enough to purchase a new machine).",1
Installed in 10 seconds.,1
Used as replacement for my Keurig. They were a little larger than the original filter but worked.,1
These work great,1
The installation of the washer pads was a breeze.,0
I must say that these are of excellent quality and really meet the standards.,0
"these Ultrasac 18-gallon white plastic bags are exactly what I was looking for. They work well in my 15 gallon trash can. By having a different color, weight and feel they are easier to identify and hold up a lot better than the usual black garbage bags.",1

"Easy set up, fairly quiet. So happy to find a dishwasher that works in my tiny 50's kitchen. Didn't exactly fit under the cabinet so I got a rolling stand. Doesn't vibrate much. Very stable on the stand. I'm single, so plenty capacity and my Fiesta plates fit fine. Dishes come out really clean. Wash cycles have a good range of choices, though the default is really long. Easy to change, tho. Very satisfied.",1
It is exactly what I ordered as a replacement burner element for my stove.  appears to be same quality as original.,1
This product is a perfect fit for its price.,0

"Truly liked this little ice maker until yesterday.  Cleaned it yesterday as I do biweekly.  It says ADD WATER and it is full of water.  No Idea how to reset it other that turn it off for awhile.  HOLD the clean button.  Clean again.  Blow out the vent to make sure no sensor has dust.  The silly thing will not stay running because it thinks it is out of water.  SEARCH ON LINE FOR A MANUAL, this machine seems to be discontinued and no longer supported.  Anyone have a manual?<br /><br />Any ideas???",1
"The pitcher is good, but I found the utensil to be a bit flimsy, so I procured another.",1
"The magnet would not stick to the Douro, I even put 2 magnets on there but it kept coming off. I tried 2 sided tape but it still didn't hold. I returned the item and tried a different kind.",1

This filter has held up with the continued use .<br />But I have been careful on when and how I clean it .<br />I am the only one that will use it so it will last a wile.,1

Easy to use and cheaper for the everyday coffee drinker.,1
"I like using my own coffee, but I am not a fan of sludge (sediment) in the last drink of my coffee. It keeps the sludge (and I am sure some of the taste, but I am ok with that) out of my cup.",1
Does it wash things? Yes. Does it wrong water entirely out of the clothes? Yes. Did it also bring my water bill $70 higher by using it once a week for just my kids clothes? Also yes.,1
It's a filter.,1
"These were more shallow than another set I had and do not cover the burners all the way because of that, but they seem like the paint is not too thin. I'm hoping over time the paint will endure.",1

Very easy to use. Very quiet,1
Fit perfect- works great! Very easy to install.,1
This product may work for some but just didn't work for me.,1
"I live in an apartment complex built in the 1960s so some of the units have older electric appliances. My rage is an old Frigidaire and those cheap metal drip pans just turn ugly and are really hard to clean. So, I tries these and they work great. Over a year of use and they are still like brand new; even after many, many washings. Sturdy, no discoloration and easy to clean. 100% this is a 5-star product",1
Does NOT work as described in the video in the listing!.....Coffee goes EVERYWHERE!,1
These handy paper inserts for my single cup brewer are a great addition.,0
Bought a month or 2 ago and its still working great,1
"We were more than pleased with the part quality, price, and delivery speed.",0
Excellent choice.,0
"I am very happy to have found these! My husband and I have an Esperta2 machine. I've been happy with the prefilled pods that are available, but my husband prefers his whole bean coffee. This allows him the convenience of using the Esperta with his own coffee. These work well in our machine. You do have to make sure you line up the little hole correctly when you insert it into the machine. The directions explain how fine or coarse the coffee needs to be for using it. It comes with a spoon and brush. We used to have a Tassimo machine and there were not any reusuable pods that worked with it, so I am pleased that we found these. I'm excited to be able to use some nice flavored coffee beans. I love that these cut down on trash, too! **Update 5/21/2017 - I am still using these and still like them. However, I did want to add something to my review. They don't come out of the pod holder very easily. I usually have to turn the holder upside down and tap it slightly to get it to come out. When doing that, that sometimes dislodges the little filter screen. I didn't realize that it had come out one time and I threw it in the trash with the coffee grounds. Now that I know that can happen, I make sure that it's still there. And if it has come dislodged, I make sure to find it before I throw out the grounds. It's easy to put back in - it just snaps in place. I didn't realize it was even missing until I made coffee the next time with that pod and my coffee was full of grounds! Just wanted to share that.",1
"The main problem that appears to not be disclosed is that it only displays dry, normal, wet in a narrow ""comfort band"" of temperatures. I expected a much wider band to know how close my environment is to being too damp or dry for storing things. Kind of useless piece of junk in terms of the hygrometer.",1
"The product was delivered promptly, packaged securely, and has been used once.",0
"Upon initial inspection, the product appears to be of high quality and meets expectations.",0
This product is a fantastic choice for anyone looking to quickly dry their laundry.,0

Fits great and able to use - much easier to use I instead of filters,1
These are great to stack and keep eggs from cracking.,1
Quick and simple installation was a breeze.,0
"I must say, I was quite impressed with the ease of installation provided by my cousin.",0
I always change my filter every 3 months. But at the name brand price it used to make me wince. Now that I have found these it is a lot easier to replace ad needed. They fit perfectly with no leaks.,1
I have been buying the Samsung filters at Lowe's for $50 plus tax. They last 6 months. I started researching replacement filters and tried a couple before this brand. I have purchased these about 4 times. They last 6 months each and are $18.00. I can handle that. If not installed properly they can back out and leak. Be sure to apply with a firm hand.,1
"These did not fit, my counter isn't quite level with the stove so it won't work.  Did not return in time because I waited to try to put them on.  So I'm stuck with them, looking for another use for these.  lol",1
Cleans up well & reuse.,1
Looks like new!!!,1
So much better than what came with my keurig! Easy to use and clean. I like having several so I can get things ready for a couple days.,1

Door was a perfect fit and was simple to install. The price was considerably lower than any other source that I checked.,1
These reusable single-serve coffee maker cup Liners are a great addition to the eco-friendly and sustainable lifestyle.,0
Worked great,1
"Exact same design that I needed. Because of machine oil used during the manufacturing process I recommend washing thoroughly before using. The tab is plastic, so my advice to you is not to clean them in the dishwasher using the heat dry cycle. It will melt the tabs.",1
<br />I recently needed a Whirlpool side by side light kit for my refrigerator.,0
The freezer is a great addition to any small kitchen or living space.,0

Excellent fit.  Very good replacement of original ones.,1

We were thrilled to find the exact OEM part we needed for a fraction of the cost at the appliance store.,0
"I needed for a Whirlpool side by side light kit. First the OEM freezer light went out, lived with it dark in the freezer. Then a year later the top fridge light went out and took the back fridge light with it. Couldn't live with a totally dark fridge and freezer. looked around and found best prices here at Amazon for all new light kits. Anyhow, a bit of brute force to pop out the old lights.  Now, its lit up brighter than I even remember the old ones being. I did wait over a month to be sure they did not die right away as some mentioned. Hope these lights last till I sell the house or have to replace the fridge many years from now.<br /><br />If the brand of fridge is listed. Give them a try. Happy I did.",1
The product is quite straightforward to assemble and provides a flexible design for various uses.,0
"I like it. It gets the clothes clean. This is embarrassing, but I live in Louisiana. It's hot and humid, and I walk 15 minutes to my car to and from everyday. So you sweat...down there. When I hand washed clothes I'd leave them in the tub to soak for 30 minutes then wash and rinse them. They'd smell fresh at first but within an hour of wearing them the sweat smell would come back as though there was residual sweat from last time.<br /><br />Not so with the Wonder Washer! Undies stay fresh all day! However, as another viewer said, the lid is flimsy. It's a lot of work to wash, drain, and fill up with water again for the rinse then to have to wring out the clothes.<br /><br />And it is a messy process bc the machine really takes out a lot of color (unlike other washing machines I use) so it looks like i'm dumping food coloring in my white tub and it takes some clean up.",1
This pellet ice machine is quite impressive.,0
Samsung replacement filters are an excellent choice for maintaining the purity of your air.,0
"oh my gosh, this is the noisiest machine I have ever owned!  you can hear the squealing and knocking across the house.  just can't believe such an expensive, name brand washer sounds like it does.  on the other hand, very very happy with it's mate - the Whirlpool Cabrio Dryer.<br /><br />..... but they're a pair :(",1
The product is a quality addition to any system.,0

"01/23 update: I tried a different brand of lids when I ran out‚Ä¶ I came back SO FAST! Others failed me miserably!If you take a minute to do the steps, these can work like a charm.",0
"This is a high quality machine, worth every penny. I hand wash my clothes, ring them out as best I can and load them into the laundry spinner, per the instructions. When the spinner cycle is complete, my clothes are barely damp. The machines pump the water out via the external spout, removing about 1/2 a square dish washing pan. It's really amazing.<br />I learned right away to load the clothes exactly as instructed, otherwise the load is not balanced & the machine wobbled/walks & makes a racket. Once I understood exactly how to load it, it runs whisper-quiet & does not wobble or move during operation.<br />There is a safety lock button which must b pushed to open the top. The lid must be closed & locked to engage the on/off slide bar. The cord is heavy duty with a grounded plug. The drain spout is at a good height & sticks out far enough to easily slide a standard square dish washing bucket under it. It works great with a good quality collapsing bucket, as well. There are recessed side grip handles the make it easy to move.<br />Excellent product.",1
I highly recommend this product for its quality and reliability.,0
Perfect! Delivered right to my door no going from store to store looking for the right filter!,1

Does the job and I m grateful to be blue to find replacement parts,1
"This works in my Frigidaire Model J51-23, so what's not to love. It is exactly the same filter as the one that came with the fridge. Also, it was easy to install.  I removed my old one by pressing in and then pulling out. To install this one, I removed the cover on the prongs and then lined the ridge line up with the receptacle and pushed it in place.",1
"The installation process for this GE refrigerator was a breeze, as the unit comes with clear-cut instructions that even a non-professional can follow with ease.",0
"The product performs exceptionally well in terms of stain removal, ensuring that even the most stubborn stains are lifted with ease.",0
"I didn't expect Waterdrop to last as long or longer than the more advertised and/or expensive brands, but it does! My water has NO additional flavor - just pure water! AND one Waterdrop filter lasts us about 8-9 months vs. the usual 3-4 months of others we've tried. Impressive",1
"I recently purchased this portable ice maker, and overall it has been a great addition to my home.",0
"The product fits perfectly and is as strong as it should be, making it an excellent choice for any user.",0
"The gas valve was replaced, and the dryer now operates efficiently and consistently.",0
Great product and price.,1
Works well just like brand name ones,1
"These are ok... I am always looking for ways to make my Keurig more cost effective. These disposable filters are meant to be used with your &#34;use your own coffee&#34; inserts.  They do make it easy to pull out the grounds from your insert, but once they are wet, they edges are hard to grab up. Definitely wait until it has cooled a second or two before grabbing it. Also, it limits the amount of coffee you can actually put in the insert. After you start buying the inserts (plastic, stainless steel..etc), the cups for the inserts, etc...  I keep wondering if I should just go back to buying the Kcups.  It's still a bit cheaper, even with these paper liners so then I guess it comes down to if you want to do the 2 second kcup or spend a minute or two filling your insert.  A personal choice for everyone to make.",1
What's easy to install.<br />Instructions were easy to understand.,1
Fist few months great  then it tarnished from the inside üòü.<br />Had to throw out the inside is not stainless steel,1
This product is a great addition to any coffee lover's collection.,0
This product offers user-friendly features that are both efficient and cost-effective.,0
"I double filter my water, these are the second system. I use a pitcher filter and then pour that into the water reservoir.It tastes fantastic. Before I bought the pitcher, I only used these, and they worked great. I just get more mileage from them this way.",1
"I like the ice cube shapes,takes a while to make.I make them then store them in a zip lock and put them in the freezer.",1
arrived on time fit my fridge perfectly,1
I am very pleased to inform you that I have tested this product and it performs exceptionally well.,0

We were delighted to add this refrigerator to our home.,0
really handy,1
This product is an exceptional choice for efficient drying.,0
Worked like a champ.,1
After buying this ice machine just 15 months ago and using it 5 times per month it's now leaking so bad I can't use it anymore. The company has refused to replace it!,1
I do not like that the spin cycle is smaller then the washing side. It takes up a hell of a lot of time. I do not like that the drain tube is at the bottom. You have to lay it flat in a bathtub or we put it in a huge trash bag on the floor and held it till it was done draining. Then dumped in the sink or tub. A lot of work!! The spin cycle side is extremely touchy. You can put two or three pieces of small clothing and it'll still knock around like crazy. I don't recommend this unless you don't have a washer and dryer and cannot afford to get to a laundro mat. This spin side does not dry! You will need to hang clothes to dry or get a portable dryer like we did.,1
Does the job perfectly!,1
"Outside unit off by 5 degrees. Inside unit temp doesn't work at all, nor does humidity reading. Too bad, nice looking units.",1
Wish u could write a great review.  But they were the wrong size bearings for my washer.  So I had to return them.,1
Perfect cup holder for my grill master husband!,1
I highly recommend this product due to its exceptional value for money.,0
Samsung produces high-quality filters that are designed to fit perfectly and provide lasting performance.,0
I love these easy to use and toss filters instead of kcups. I have kcups for company and I use the filters and do my own.. Best thing ever.. thank you,1
"The freezer works well, is quiet and is good for a small space. It has a small dent on the corner but nothing to drastic. Thinker foam in the packaging could prevent that. I would give it more stars but somehow I made a duplicate order. No idea how, that part's on me. I requested a return for one of the freezers more than a week ago and have had no response from the seller. Amazon indicated that the seller would email a return label within 48 hours. The extra freezer is in the original box waiting to be sent back.",1
I am quite impressed with these stove top covers.,0

Valve didn't come with these little cylinder things.  Ordered these yesterday,installed in a couple of minutes.  Thank you for the rapid delivery and very reasonably priced repair!",1

Perfect.  Exactly as described. Fast delivery.,1
"These door handle covers are quite festive. It comes with a pair - Santa and Mrs. Clause. They don't fasten tight enough to keep them where I want (the middle of the handles) and instead they fall to the bottom no matter what I do! They still look cute, but it's not exactly what I wanted. The stickers, however, are awesome! I have been putting them on the backs of my Christmas card envelopes.",1
"The oven, after their repair now the heat climbs to over 550 degrees if if set-at 300. I am so disgusted I spent money on this.",1
"Perfect!  I am not typically &#34;handy&#34; - my husband actually takes care of things that require one to be &#34;handy&#34;.  However, I changed these parts on my dishwasher by my self and am quite proud over it!  The instructions were a little challenging, but after spending 15-20 minutes changing the first side - it only took about 5 minutes to change the second side.  If I can do it, anyone can!!<br /><br />The quality of these parts are a huge improvement over the original parts and I know they will not need to be changed again for a very long time!",1
Like anyone else im attracted to the rainbow aesthetic as it is pleasing to the eye. However; this rainbow is made of sadness as my Keurig doesnt register that im trying to make coffee and says that it doesnt recongize the K-Cup that im using. Its too late to return them as i didnt try and make coffee for a few months after buying this happiness imposter. I guess now i shall bury the bringer of sadness in a cupboard and let my ADHD do the rest. Outa sight outa mind.,1

"I bought this to fix my Whirlpool dryer that was not drying properly.  Specs said these were the elements/parts needed to solve the problem. The problem is that not all the parts were compatible with my dryer. The heating element and thermal fuse worked and the others did not. I had to buy additional parts to replace the non-compatible parts. In the end, it cost me twice as much and three extra days to make the repair.",1

"I love the ease of using and making my capsule.  The ‚Äòcap' top makes sealing the foil sooooooo easy and accurately.  Much better than using your fingers, which is what I use in my other refill kit.  This additional piece gets my thumbs up.  Very good value with the 100 foils.  Works really well with my machine.",1

"There are times when the ice maker on the refrigerator can't keep up with our ice needs. Usually that's when we're entertaining or going out and taking the cooler somewhere. This counter top ice maker will hopefully make life easier. We set this up and followed the directions. It didn't take long before we started making ice. It is a slow process. It took about 2 hours to fill the ice basket. This isn't something you can just start doing to get a lot of ice right away. However, if you plan in advance, it should be fine. We will start making ice the night before it's needed then bag it up and put it in the freezer. I love that this maker recycles the melted water. That's a great idea! While it is noisy, it's more of a white noise than anything else. We found it to not be distracting. We like the shapes of the ice cubes. My husband thought it would be nice if the front of the maker was see through so you could see how much ice you have without having to peer down into it. Overall, this works well and makes decent ice cubes.",1
"Everything is running smoothly, and I'm glad to report that I'm quite pleased with the performance.",0
"This filter offers top-notch performance, with its advanced design providing a crystal clear and efficient filtration experience.",0
I found the reusable k-cup type cup liners to be quite efficient and handy.,0

"These filters were purchased for our Samsung refrigerator that requires the DA29-00020B filter. The first filter of the 3 pack we just bought started leaking 8 days after installation, flooding the lower refrigerator and started filling up the bottom door freezer. Luckily for us we noticed the water running down into the freezer it before it started to spill out into the kitchen. We installed the 2nd filter hoping the first was just a defective part and just replaced the 2nd filter this evening, 5 days later. It was leaking just like the first filter, not massive amounts but a slow leak that unchecked would have flooded the whole refrigerator again. We have installed the 3rd filter which is holding for now but have also ordered Samsung OEM replacements and will not try &#34;compatible&#34; replacements ever again. It's very apparent when the comparing the mating features of the OEM filter and this replacement, there's a enough of a difference that makes this filter a less than ideal replacement for the DA29-00020B. If they work for you, great, but for our Samsung refrigerator, it was a waste of money.",1

"I recently purchased this switch from Amazon for my Kenmore dryer, and it has been a life-saver!In a matter of minutes, the issue was resolved, and I am now able to use my dryer without any issues.",0
"I have been trying to find something that cleans my 6 year old dish washer and in the past it was run the machine empty.  Although we have never noticed any deterioration in the wonderful cleaning of our dishwasher, I was super excited to find the branded cleaning product so it can have its own spa day!  It certainly left the interior of my washing machine smelling that 'fresh' bleached smell, which for us who have gone 'green', I hope it s gentle to the environment.  The product tells you to use it couple times a year, but since we are quite careful not to put heavy greasy dishes, I will try it once a year.  We also use a low sud and environmentally conscious tablet (ecover) that also helps to clean your dishwasher.  I am happy we found it and to keep our dishwasher functioning longer!",1
I was pleasantly surprised by the exceptional quality of these replacement products.,0
"Perfectly fits, easy to use - a great, convenient gadget.",0
I highly recommend these filters for anyone looking for a reliable and cost-effective solution.,0
"1.  The exhaust ""hose"" is ridiculous -- hard plastic, totally unusable; had to purchase a regular flexible kit at the hardware store.<br /><br />2.  UPDATE MARCH 2013 --  Initial review in parens (Major complaint is the lint filter.  First time cleaning was no problem, it popped right back into place.  Second time - no such luck, it refuses to pop back in place -- very frustrating.  The two loads I was able to dry came out just fine, but without that lint filter in place, it's now just a dust collector !)  Problem solved; just make sure you pay attention when replacing the filter sections, I had mine reversed, thus it would not ""connect""!  Thanks to a patient customer service rep for sending me photos, I finally noticed I had the thing reversed.  Dryer is back in working order and I am loving it !!!",1
Magnet is not as heavy and does not offer the same quality as the original the washer came with however it still works and does the job!,1
They are a good replacement for the stove.,1
These paper cone filters are so great!! No odor from the natural paper and they are so durable!! They do not impart any flavor into your brewing coffee!! Just great full coffee ‚òïÔ∏è servings!! Excellent value for your $!! Been purchasing these for at least  3 years!!,1
"the product was as advertised, arrived quickly, and performed flawlessly.",0
what a great deal and it even had a little coffee scooper !!!!!!!!!  i paid this for 1 in Target  when i first got my Keurig last year !!!,1
Impressively engineered and top of the line.,0
The product photos should be carefully examined before purchasing.,0
Perfect scoop,1
"I just needed a little extra freezer space, this fit the bill perfectly! It actually holds a lot more than I expected. Delivery was very fast and setting it up was a breeze. Switched the door to open from the right and let it stand for about a day per instructions. I have not been disappointed. Highly recommend if you're looking for a little extra freezer space without taking up a lot of space.",1

Bought this to replace my smaller portable wash machine! Large wash basin! I can wash all my clothes in one load! The spinner is amazing! Spins items practically dry! It can get off off kilter and I just hold it until it stops! No more wasting quarters in the laundry room!!! Wish I had this machine a year ago!,1
I'm extremely pleased with the dairy cover replacement I purchased.,0
I am very happy. It looks even better than the picture!,1
"I was delighted to find the exact replacement burner element for my stove, and it exceeded my expectations in terms of quality.",0
im excited to see how the coffee comes out  i got 2 mason jars too  so i ordered a 2nd one of these so i'll always have 2 in the fridge  for the summer<br /><br />UPDATE:  my first cup was a bit strong  i added way too much coffee i guess but i watered it down with plenty of ice and  half and half - a little cinnamon and vanilla -  i ordered the 2nd filter and it will be here soon and i plan to have iced coffee all summer ...  definitely cutting down on the amount of coffee though !!!!!,1
The product fits perfectly and I highly recommend it.,0
And I use it in conjunction with the filters that fit this... My Keureg 2.0 is liberated! I get to drink my favorite coffee by the carafe full! Yay!!,1
I purchased a single cup brewer that has the option of your own coffee... came with a cup to do that - but it is a pain to clean - so I buy these... it's a taller single cup holder so these taller liners are perfect.  I have one cup of coffee a day - and sometimes none at all - so these will last me a good long time.  I like that they are non-bleached - the less chemicals the better in my mind.,1
This product offers a consistent flow of coffee and is designed to prevent filter basket clogging.,0
The product was a perfect replacement for the original bins.,1
